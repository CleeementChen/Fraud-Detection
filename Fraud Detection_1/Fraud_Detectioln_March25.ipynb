Chronicle=20\\nJan. 23, 2002, 12:35AM\\nAttorneys for Enron shareholders agreed late Tuesday on a proposed restrain=\\ning order to safeguard financial documents and investigate their destructio=\\nn by employees of the company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20\\nAlso on Tuesday, FBI agents began an initial investigation into claims that=\\n as recently as Monday Enron employees were still shredding documents.=20\\nMore than a dozen lawyers representing scores of plaintiffs hammered out th=\\ne agreement after being told earlier in the day by U.S. District Judge Meli=\\nnda Harmon to draft a temporary restraining order they could agree on.=20\\nThe lawyers will submit the order to Arthur Andersen this morning for revie=\\nw.

All Rights Reserved\\n\\nBACK PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Shredding storm may leave Enron's defence in ta=\\ntters - Revelations raise questions about what group was trying to hide, sa=\\nys Peter Spiegel.=20\\nIt has become axiomatic in the world of US political and financial scandals=\\n that it is not the original wrongdoing that brings down the powerful - it =\\nis the cover-up.\\nDuring Watergate, the measure by which all American scandals are judged, th=\\ne break-in at Democratic party headquarters by a handful of amateur burglar=\\ns would not have led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. It was his e=\\nffort to conceal the burglars' ties to his campaign that forced him out of =\\noffice.=20\\nSimilarly, in the past week the escalating Enron controversy has shifted fr=\\nom a complicated inquiry into possibly improper use of accounting principle=\\ns, to an examination of document-shredding at both Enron and its Andersen a=\\nuditors - and what they were trying to hide.=20\\nEnron said yesterday that the question had already become the subject of a =\\nFederal Bureau of Investigation probe. Following accusations by aformer emp=\\nloyee that Enron officials were destroying records, the company's lawyers y=\\nesterday asked the Justice Department to send in FBI agents to find out wha=\\nt happened.=20\\nOn Capitol Hill, the shredding has also turned perceptions of Enron. Once v=\\niewed as a high-flyer with a failed business model and some questionable ac=\\ncounting practices, top investigators are increasingly convinced there was =\\nlong-term dishonesty at the heart of the company.=20\\n\"There's no question in my mind the conduct of Enron and some key figures a=\\nt Andersen served to deprive investors of information they should have had,=\\n\" Republican James Greenwood, head of one of the most important congression=\\nal inquiries, said in an interview this week. \"That was done for very uneth=\\nical reasons.\"=20\\nWhen the collapse of Enron, once the US's seventh largest company, remained=\\n a question of accounting rules, defences were plausible. Off-balance sheet=\\n partnerships are, after all, perfectly legal and they enabled the company =\\nto avoid scrutiny of its debts.=20\\nBut when the losses were fully disclosed on October 16, investors fled and =\\nthe giant energy trader sank into bankruptcy.=20\\nThe closeness of the relationships between Enron and the partnerships have =\\nled to questions about whether they were truly independent companies operat=\\ning at arm's length, but Enron lawyers have repeatedly pointed out that the=\\n practice of using them can be found in any graduate accounting text book.=\\n=20\\nShredding documents, however, is not in any text book. Record destruction b=\\ny itself can be a crime, particularly when it occurs after the opening of a=\\n federal investigation or the filing of a lawsuit.=20\\nAndersen's shredding began in earnest on October 23, the day after Enron pu=\\nblicly acknowledged it had been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Co=\\nmmission, the US financial regulator. It continued until November 9, the da=\\ny after Andersen received an SEC subpoena.=20\\nIf former Enron employees are to be believed, Enron itself was shredding do=\\ncuments about the private partnerships just last week - months after the op=\\nening of a formal SEC investigation, weeks after the filings of dozens of l=\\nawsuits and days after the Justice Department acknowledged it had launched =\\na criminal inquiry into the company.=20\\nBeyond the potential criminality of the record destruction, however, the ac=\\nt of shredding brings with it practical and legal assumptions which call in=\\nto question the very defences Enron and Andersen have made of their account=\\ning practices. If the partnerships were indeed perfectly legitimate, why th=\\ne need to destroy documents?=20\\nThere are also signals that the shredding revelations have moved the Enron =\\ncontroversy from the realm of hard-core scandal-watchers into US living roo=\\nms. Early last week, Gallup issued a poll that showed only 18 per cent of t=\\nhe American public was following Enron news very closely. But yesterday, Ma=\\nureen Castaneda, the former Enron executive accusing the company of shreddi=\\nng, could be seen everywhere on television news.=20\\nIn their defence, Enron and Andersen have insisted there was no company-wid=\\ne order to destroy papers. Andersen has attempted to point the finger at it=\\ns Houston office, where it has fired David Duncan, its lead Enron auditor, =\\nand disciplined seven colleagues. But it is a defence that has been difficu=\\nlt to maintain following revelations that officials from Andersen's Chicago=\\n head office were having frequent discussions with Mr Duncan about Enron's =\\ntroubles well before the shredding began.=20\\nIt is now Enron's turn to make its case, arguing that it sent repeated miss=\\nives ordering staff to gather documents, as legally required of companies f=\\nacing litigation. One such e-mail, obtained by the Financial Times and sent=\\n on October 31, congratulated employees on their \"excellent work\" at securi=\\nng electronic data. \"Please err on the side of retention of documents,\" the=\\n e-mail said.=20\\nThe shredding storm may prove immaterial for the company, already in bankru=\\nptcy. But the revelations could make all the difference when the time comes=\\n to judge whether anyone at Enron should land in prison.

We've got to make sure our homeland is secure. And we'v=\\ne got to make sure people can find work.\"=20\\nTo respond to Enron's problems, Bush has called for more corporate disclosu=\\nre of financial information and directed the Labor Department to look into =\\ntighter regulation of 401(k) retirement accounts.=20\\nBut the president has balked at releasing information about all administrat=\\nion contacts with Enron unless there is an accusation of wrongdoing.=20\\n\"If somebody has an accusation of wrongdoing, just let me know,\" he said. T=\\nhe administration recently revealed that Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill an=\\nd Commerce Secretary Don Evans spoke with Lay last fall but concluded nothi=\\nng should be done to help the company.=20\\nWhite House economics adviser Lawrence Lindsey also studied the Enron situa=\\ntion and reached the same conclusion.=20\\nBush also defended the administration's decision not to release records of =\\nVice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which met six times with En=\\nron officials last year.=20\\n\"We laid out the energy report. It's fully disclosed,\" Bush said.=20\\nBut critics, including many Democratic lawmakers and environmentalists, arg=\\nued that accounts of the task force meetings may reveal how Bush's top cont=\\nributors in the energy industry, including Enron, played a major role in sh=\\naping the energy blueprint.=20\\nSen. John Kerry, D-Mass, who unveiled an alternative to Bush's energy plan =\\non Tuesday, said that Enron and other companies were allowed an \"access bon=\\nanza \" to Cheney's task force.=20\\n\"As a result, those most heavily invested in the current energy system have=\\n set a course for the future, which, surprisingly, champions status-quo pol=\\nicies at the expense of new ideas and innovation,\" Kerry said.=20\\nThe Massachusetts senator and possible presidential contender in 2004 said =\\nenergy policy should focus on raising fuel standards for large vehicles and=\\n increasing government incentives for renewable energy like wind and solar =\\npower.=20\\nKerry opposed Bush's proposal for drilling in Alaska's environmentally sens=\\nitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.=20\\nThe president renewed his call for drilling in Alaska in a speech to worker=\\ns in West Virginia. And deep in the heart of the coal mining belt, Bush dre=\\nw cheers when he said, \"We need to use coal.\"=20\\nBush spokesman Ari Fleischer denied the allegation by Democrats and environ=\\nmentalists that Cheney's task force was largely influenced by the energy in=\\ndustry and said environmentalists such as the Sierra Club had equal access.=\\n=20\\n\"The president thinks that access should be across the board. And that's wh=\\ny the Sierra Club, for example, as you know, met repeatedly with the energy=\\n task force,\" Fleischer said.=20\\nHowever, a Sierra Club official said the group met just twice with the admi=\\nnistration and only after the energy task force report was unveiled last Ma=\\ny.=20\\n\"I think Mr. Fleischer is mistaken.

Mr. Johnson said the committee plans to hold a=\\ndditional hearings into alleged document destruction at Enron \"very soon.\"=\\n=20\\nAlso yesterday, President Bush offered his most extensive defense to date o=\\nf his administration's handling of the Enron debacle, saying officials acte=\\nd properly in refusing to help the company avoid bankruptcy court and portr=\\naying his own family as a victim of the collapse.=20\\nAsked about Enron by a reporter while visiting a West Virginia factory to p=\\nromote his economic agenda, Mr. Bush said Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill a=\\nnd Commerce Secretary Donald Evans did the \"exact right thing\" in refusing =\\nto help Enron CEO Kenneth Lay when he called during the fall seeking federa=\\nl intervention. \"My cabinet officers said: `No help here,' \" he said.=20\\nMr. Bush said his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, bought 200 shares of Enron st=\\nock on Sept. 21, 1999, at $40.90 each for a total of $8,180.

Mr. Bauer's account, relayed by a per=\\nson familiar with his interview, appears to bolster Mr. Duncan's defense. M=\\nr.

Like Mr. Duncan, Mr. Bauer also said he didn't think it was necessary =\\nto preserve all Enron-related documents because Andersen hadn't received a =\\nsubpoena at that point.=20\\nCongressional investigators are dubious of that defense, especially given t=\\nhat Andersen's Houston office in early November was sent a copy of a direct=\\nive from Enron executives to its own employees to preserve all documents. \"=\\nIt sounds like they are pleading idiocy,\" said Mr. Johnson, the Tauzin spok=\\nesman.=20\\nExperts say Mr. Duncan appears to be preparing an \"advice-of-counsel\" defen=\\nse -- that he had no criminal intent because he was following a policy sent=\\n by Ms. Temple, the Andersen lawyer.

Schultz and Theo Francis\\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n01/23/2002\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nA4\\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nAt a time when Enron Corp. was cutting back on its employee retirement plan=\\ns to save money, executive benefits at the energy company kept getting rich=\\ner.=20\\nBeginning in the 1990s, Enron joined many other U.S. companies in trimming =\\nits employee-pension and savings-plan benefits to cut costs. But throughout=\\n the same period, Enron also was continuing to offer a lavish set of pensio=\\nn and retirement plans for its top executives.\\nThose benefits, including a lifelong pension and company-paid insurance pre=\\nmiums for Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, are likely to come under more scruti=\\nny, given the effect of Enron's collapse on the company's employees. The U.=\\nS. Department of Labor today will hold a briefing on its investigation of E=\\nnron's retirement plan.=20\\nNot only did Enron workers lose their benefits when they lost their jobs, b=\\nut they also have seen their retirement plans gutted as Enron's stock, whic=\\nh accounted for as much as 60% of the company's 401(k) plan, has dropped to=\\n about 50 cents a share from a peak of $90 last year.=20\\nAt the same time that employees were locked into much of the Enron stock in=\\n their 401(k) plans, executives last year sold shares valued at about $128 =\\nmillion, on top of $486 million in sales in 2000, according to Thomson Fina=\\nncial/Lancer Analytics, which tracks insider transactions. Mr. Lay alone so=\\nld shares valued at $29.8 million during that period.=20\\nAccording to company filings, Enron will pay Mr. Lay a pension estimated at=\\n $475,042 a year for life. In addition, as part of an agreement Mr. Lay sig=\\nned with the company in 1996, it agreed to pay a total of $1.25 million in =\\ninsurance premiums through 2001 on a $12 million life insurance policy. Oth=\\ner executives have similar pension or insurance agreements with Enron.=20\\nSuch so-called \"split-dollar\" policies are used to channel executive pensio=\\nn benefits into vehicles that executives can tap or pass on to their heirs,=\\n mostly tax-free.=20\\nEnron also has a kind of executive 401(k), established in the 1980s, which =\\nguarantees executives in the plan minimum returns of 12%.=20\\nIn addition, at the time the company was reducing pensions for most of its =\\nemployees, Enron set up an executive savings plan that lets participating e=\\nxecutives contribute 25% of their salaries and 100% of their cash bonuses e=\\nach year. The participants were guaranteed a 9% return on the first two yea=\\nrs of the plan, and they were allowed to put their money into an array of i=\\nnvestments -- not just Enron stock.=20\\nWhile the existence of Enron's executive benefits is outlined in company fi=\\nlings and Securities and Exchange Commission documents, the total cost of t=\\nhe pension and retirement promises to Enron executives is nearly impossible=\\n to measure. The cost of the split-dollar arrangements is largely invisible=\\n (only the premiums are reported as an expense), and the benefits that accr=\\nue in the executive savings plans (also known as deferred-compensation plan=\\ns) aren't required to be disclosed. An Enron spokesman didn't respond to re=\\nquests for comment.=20\\nHowever, filings show that the liability for the executive pensions was $56=\\n million in 2000, or about 8% of the total pension liability for all employ=\\nees and retirees.=20\\nThe documents do show that at the same time that Enron was beefing up retir=\\nement benefits for its top executives, it was cutting them for its other wo=\\nrkers.=20\\nAccording to SEC filings, in 1986 Enron set up an employee stock-ownership =\\nplan, which bought 8.7 million shares of Enron stock in exchange for a note=\\n of $335 million. To pay off much of this debt, the company in January 1987=\\n terminated its overfunded pension plan, and transferred the $230 million i=\\nn surplus assets, tax-free, to the ESOP.=20\\nMeanwhile, the company set up a new pension plan, transferring into it the =\\nassets and liabilities from the old plan; the new plan, though no longer ov=\\nerfunded, was less costly than the old one.=20\\nBut even though Enron set up an ESOP and a new pension, this doesn't mean E=\\nnron employees were to enjoy benefits from both a pension and an ESOP. That=\\n is because Enron created a so-called \"floor-offset\" arrangement between th=\\ne pension and the ESOP. That meant the benefits employees earned in one pla=\\nn essentially erased benefits earned in the other. These arrangements have =\\nbeen used by many companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co. and Airborne Inc=\\n.=20\\nA major reason why companies set up these arrangements is to reduce their p=\\nension expense. And, indeed, the \"offset\" contributed to a significant decl=\\nine in Enron's pension expense, which was $3.6 million in 1987. After the o=\\nffset was established, instead of an expense, Enron's pension actually cont=\\nributed $9.6 million to Enron's bottom line in 1988.=20\\nIn an unusual step, Enron calculated the ESOP \"offsets\" based on the price =\\nof the stock from 1996 to 2000, when it was trading between $37.75 and $43.=\\n44. As previously reported in The Wall Street Journal, it then used the hig=\\nher locked-in value of the ESOP accounts to permanently cut the value of pe=\\nnsions that employees had earned between January 1987 and January 1995. Acc=\\nording to filings, employees had $116 million in ESOP assets at the end of =\\n2000. The assets now are nearly worthless.=20\\nSome Enron employees still will receive their pensions -- albeit at the red=\\nuced values. How much employees lost depends on the size of the pensions th=\\ney had earned, and the value of their ESOP accounts from 1996 to 2000.=20\\nThis arrangement comes to light because Enron sought -- and received -- per=\\nmission from the Labor Department to change its plan in this fashion; compa=\\nny documents also indicate that Mr. Lay's pension wasn't affected by the ES=\\nOP offset.=20\\nNot only were the past pensions permanently erased, but the pension going f=\\norward, in 1996, also was reduced. At that time, Enron converted the tradit=\\nional pension to a cash-balance pension, which reduces the benefits build-u=\\np for longer-term, older workers.=20\\nThis fall, as the company slid toward bankruptcy, Enron said it might freez=\\ne the pensions of all employees, and it stopped contributing to the 401(k).=\\n=20\\n---=20\\nCassell Bryan-Low contributed to this article.=20\\n--- Do Unto Others . . .\\n\\nWhat Enron did to its retirement plans:\\n\\n-- Used ESOP to get surplus assets from pension plan, tax free.\\n-- Used ESOP to cut pension expense.\\n-- Used ESOP to offset pension benefits.\\n-- Stopped contributing to ESOPs.\\n-- Converted pension to cash balance pension plan.\\n-- Froze pension plan of union employees.\\n-- Locked employees in 401(k) into Enron stock until age 50.\\n-- In late 2001, stopped contributing to 401(k).\\n\\nHow this affected employees:\\n\\n-- Pensions earned before 1996 are reduced.\\n-- Pension earned after 1996 are cut.\\n-- Pensions for union workers frozen; investment risk increased.\\n-- ESOPs are now worthless.\\n-- 401(k)s are devastated.\\n\\nSource: company documents\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, more than once made =\\na point last year of telling people how little he understood about the fina=\\nnces of the company he has run since 1986.=20\\nIn August, Mr. Lay said in an interview that questions about the deals that=\\n Enron used to shift debt off its books were ''way over my head.'' In Novem=\\nber, Mr. Lay told Chuck Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, which at the time h=\\nad agreed to buy Enron, that he had never fully read the financial statemen=\\nts Enron filed with federal regulators, according to Mr. Watson.\\nBut if Mr. Lay's comments left the impression that he was a hands-off chair=\\nman, a different picture has emerged over the last 10 days as to what Mr. L=\\nay knew about the company's accounting practices and when he knew it.=20\\nDisclosures by Congressional investigators and lawyers suing Enron showed t=\\nhat Mr. Lay helped create and oversee some of the company's suspect financi=\\nal arrangements. He knew that doubts had been raised about Enron's accounti=\\nng, even as he encouraged employees to buy Enron shares. About the same tim=\\ne in September and October, Mr. Lay, to avoid facing margin calls as invest=\\nments in his portfolio lost value, repaid millions in loans from Enron with=\\n company stock.=20\\nNow, employees who retained their faith in Mr. Lay even as the company was =\\ncollapsing are criticizing him for breaching their trust. At worst, experts=\\n in securities law say, investigators may view Mr. Lay's professions of ign=\\norance as a deliberate effort to distance himself from Enron's problems.=20\\n''He's got a lot of trouble,'' said James D. Cox, professor of corporate an=\\nd securities law at Duke University. Mr. Lay is at risk of facing criminal =\\ncharges of fraud or insider trading, Mr. Cox said.=20\\n''He's going to be spending a lot of time with lawyers; the real fear is on=\\n the criminal side,'' Mr. Cox said. ''He could be the next Charles Keating,=\\n'' a reference to the savings and loan operator who pleaded guilty to fraud=\\n in the 1989 failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan.=20\\nLawyers for Mr. Lay and Enron did not return calls seeking comment.=20\\nThe first blow to Mr. Lay came Jan. 14, when the House Energy and Commerce =\\nCommittee released a letter showing that as he publicly proclaimed his igno=\\nrance of Enron's financial structure in August, he had been warned by Sherr=\\non S. Watkins, an Enron vice president, that the company might ''implode in=\\n a wave of accounting scandals.'' In response to the letter, Mr. Lay direct=\\ned Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm, to conduct a limited inquiry -- a rev=\\niew that a lawyer for Ms. Watkins has called a whitewash.=20\\nLast Friday, a lawyer representing employees who have sued Enron released a=\\n 10-page transcript of an online chat between Mr. Lay and Enron employees o=\\nn Sept. 26. In the chat, Mr. Lay repeatedly promoted Enron's stock while pr=\\nomising employees that the company's financial reporting was ''legal and to=\\ntally appropriate.''=20\\nCongressional investigators, meanwhile, made public the Vinson & Elkins rep=\\nort. It showed that Mr. Lay approved the creation in 1999 of two of the par=\\ntnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investments, that have figured prominentl=\\ny in questions about the company's accounting practices.=20\\nIn the process, Enron's board, under Mr. Lay's leadership, waived the compa=\\nny's code of ethics to let its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, r=\\nun them and profit from them. Losses at those partnerships subsequently for=\\nced Enron to erase more than $500 million in shareholders equity, a measure=\\n of the company's value.=20\\nFinally, on Sunday, Earl J. Silbert, Mr. Lay's lawyer, acknowledged that Mr=\\n. Lay had sold some of his Enron stock back to the company in September and=\\n October, while Vinson & Elkins was investigating Ms. Watkins's claims. Det=\\nails of the sales, repayments of a revolving line of credit extended to Mr.=\\n Lay by Enron, do not have to be disclosed to the Securities and Exchange C=\\nommission until Feb. 14.=20\\nThe revelation that Mr. Lay encouraged Enron employees to buy stock after h=\\ne was warned about accounting problems may open him to charges of securitie=\\ns fraud, said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University School of La=\\nw in St. Louis and co-author of an 11-volume treatise on securities law. Th=\\ne fact that he was disposing of shares at the same time could open him to c=\\nharges of insider trading, Mr. Seligman added.=20\\n''If he knowingly made false statements while he traded stock, he will face=\\n criminal liability,'' Mr. Seligman said. Mr. Lay may also face S.E.C. proc=\\needings and already is a defendant in scores of lawsuits.=20\\nEven if Mr. Lay did not know the details of the partnerships used by Enron =\\nto inflate its earnings, he could be held criminally liable, Mr. Seligman s=\\naid. As long as Mr. Lay ''understood why they were created, what they were =\\nintended to do,'' he said, ''the fact that he didn't know whether they were=\\n created in Panama or the Cayman Islands is a detail that would not be mate=\\nrial.''=20\\nIra Lee Sorkin, a former director of New York office of the S.E.C. who is n=\\now a defense lawyer, cautioned against rushing to judgment. But Mr. Sorkin =\\nsaid the fact that Mr. Lay had disposed of shares after the warning from Ms=\\n. Watkins might be difficult for Mr. Lay to explain.=20\\nOther securities lawyers have said the fact that Enron, which presumably ha=\\nd the same information about its prospects as Mr. Lay, acquired his shares =\\nmight protect him from charges of insider trading.=20\\nBut Mr. Sorkin disagrees. ''If he knew of the information that we now suspe=\\nct he knew about and paid back the company, knowing full well that this sto=\\nck is going to drop like a lead balloon,'' Mr. Sorkin said, ''then he's goi=\\nng to have an issue.''\\n\\nChart: ''Filling in the Details'' Last summer and fall, as energy prices an=\\nd Enron's stock fell, Kenneth L. Lay, the company's chairman and chief exec=\\nutive, repeatedly reassured investors and employees, urging them to buy sto=\\nck and telling them that he knew of no problems at the company. Recent disc=\\nlosures show that he had been told of concerns about Enron's accounting pra=\\nctices and had disposed of millions of dollars worth of Enron stock to meet=\\n obligations on his investments. Public Comments and Disclosures AUG. 14 Wh=\\nen Jeffrey K. Skilling suddenly resigns as chief executive, citing ''person=\\nal reasons,'' Mr. Lay retakes the job. He says, ''Absolutely no accounting =\\nissue, no trading issue, no reserve issue, no previously unknown problem is=\\nsues''are behind the departure. What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG. 15=\\n In the wake of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Sherron S. Watkins, a vice pres=\\nident for corporate development, drops a one-page letter in Mr. Lay's sugge=\\nstion box. In it she raises questions about Enron's accounting practices. P=\\nublic Comments and Disclosures AUG. 16 Mr. Lay meets with employees to disc=\\nuss the departure of Mr. Skilling. What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG.=\\n 20 Ms. Watkins calls a former colleague at Arthur Andersen, Enron's accoun=\\nting firm, to tell him of her concerns. Mr. Lay exercises options on 25,000=\\n shares at $20.78 with a total value of $519,500. The stock closes at $36.2=\\n5. A lawyer for Mr. Lay subsequently explains that he used some of the stoc=\\nk to help repay a line of credit from Enron. Public Comments and Disclosure=\\ns AUG. 21 Mr. Lay sends an e-mail to employees assuring them that the compa=\\nny is on solid footing. He says in the e-mail that ''one of my highest prio=\\nrities is to restore investor confidence in Enron. This should result in a =\\nsignificantly higher stock price.'' What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG=\\n. 21 Four Andersen officials, including David B. Duncan, the lead partner o=\\nn the Enron account, meet to discuss Ms. Watkins's concerns. According to a=\\nn Andersen memo, they ''agreed to consult our firm's legal adviser about wh=\\nat actions to take'' in regard to Ms. Watkins's accusations. Mr. Lay exerci=\\nses options on 68,620 shares at $21.56 with a total value of $1,479,447. Th=\\ne stock closes at $36.88. A lawyer for Mr. Lay said he still holds these sh=\\nares, which are now trading for less than a dollar. AUG. 22 Ms. Watkins mee=\\nts with Mr. Lay. She gives him a seven-page letter in which she says that E=\\nnron may be an ''elaborate accounting hoax.'' She urges him to look into it=\\n, but not to involve the company's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, becau=\\nse it has potential conflicts of interest. Despite Ms. Watkins's concerns a=\\nbout Vinson & Elkins, the firm is asked to determine if a broad inquiry is =\\nnecessary to deal with the accusations. It is specifically told not to spen=\\nd time ''second-guessing the accounting advice and treatment.'' Public Comm=\\nents and Disclosures SEPT. 26 In an online chat with employees, Mr. Lay say=\\ns that Enron stock is a good buy and that the company's accounting methods =\\nare ''legal and totally appropriate.'' He also says that he and other senio=\\nr executives are so confident about Enron's prospects that they have bought=\\n stock within the previous two months. He concludes by saying that the comp=\\nany's third-quarter results will be very good. OCT. 16 Enron reports a thir=\\nd-quarter loss of $618 million. One day later, it reduces shareholder equit=\\ny by $1.2 billion to account for transactions involving Enron and some part=\\nnerships created by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer.

SANGER with DAVID BARBOZA\\n\\n01/23/2002\\nThe New York Times\\nPage 1, Column 5\\nc. 2002 New York Times Company\\n\\nBELLE, W.Va., Jan. 22 -- Abruptly changing his tone about a company that co=\\nntributed heavily to his political campaigns, President Bush said today tha=\\nt he was ''outraged'' that the Enron Corporation misled its employees and i=\\nnvestors, including his mother-in-law, who he said lost more than $8,000 wh=\\nen its stock collapsed.=20\\nFor the first time, Mr. Bush called for government action to force greater =\\ncorporate disclosure of financial information.\\nIn comments to reporters here before he toured a machinery shop, Mr. Bush a=\\nlso strongly defended how members of his cabinet handled calls for aid from=\\n Enron's top executives, summarizing those members' message to the company'=\\ns leaders as ''no help here.''=20\\nMr. Bush's new tone came as the scope of the Enron investigation widened. T=\\nhe company told a federal court in Houston today that on Monday night it ha=\\nd discovered more shredded documents on the 19th floor of its headquarters =\\nin Houston, suggesting that employees were destroying potential evidence de=\\nspite what the company's leaders say were orders to the contrary.=20\\nThe shredded remains were turned over to the Justice Department today, and =\\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation sealed off part of the headquarters bui=\\nlding.=20\\nMeanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce committee said it would issue subp=\\noenas to a recently dismissed partner of Arthur Andersen, the main accounti=\\nng firm for Enron and the auditor of its questionable financial arrangement=\\ns. The fired Andersen partner, David B. Duncan, may cite his Fifth Amendmen=\\nt right against self-incrimination before the committee on Thursday, invest=\\nigators said. Three others at Andersen, including the firm's chief executiv=\\ne, were also summoned.=20\\nIn his comments today, the president never mentioned Enron's chief executiv=\\ne, Kenneth L. Lay, a once-close friend whom he had nicknamed Kenny Boy and =\\nwho was the largest single contributor to Mr. Bush's campaigns since Mr. Bu=\\nsh entered politics. Nonetheless, by implication the president cut the cord=\\n with Mr. Lay today, saying, ''What I'm outraged about is that shareholders=\\n and employees didn't know all the facts about Enron.''=20\\n''My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth anythin=\\ng now,'' he said of Jenna Welch, Laura Bush's mother.=20\\nMr. Bush added later: ''She didn't know all the facts. And a lot of shareho=\\nlders didn't know all the facts. And that's wrong.''=20\\nRepublican strategists said Mr. Bush's changed tone reflected a political c=\\nalculation by the White House as Congressional hearings on the company's co=\\nllapse begin this week. They said the administration was determined not to =\\nallow Democrats to portray Enron as a problem only for Republicans.=20\\n''The dynamic over Enron cannot be that Democrats are against Enron and for=\\n reform, and we're defending Enron and against reform,'' said one strategis=\\nt who is close to the White House but who would not allow his name to be us=\\ned. ''What Enron did is outrageous, and if you don't move to correct it, it=\\n becomes an indictment of the free market. The Republican Party is the free=\\n market party. And we have to demonstrate our desire to make the market fai=\\nr and to crack down on abuse.''=20\\nBill Dal Col, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Bush's comments were an app=\\nropriate response to the widening disclosures about Enron.=20\\n''When you've got a crisis that's growing like this -- every time you turn =\\nthe page there's a new chapter of hocus-pocus accounting -- the stronger th=\\ne outrage has to be,'' Mr. Dal Col said.=20\\nAfter Mr. Bush spoke, the White House corrected the president on the timing=\\n of his mother-in-law's investment. Mrs. Welch bought 200 shares of Enron o=\\nn Sept. 21, 1999, for $40.90 a share, the White House said, for a total inv=\\nestment of $8,180. She sold her holdings on Dec. 4, two days after the comp=\\nany declared bankruptcy, for 42 cents a share, meaning her investment had p=\\nlummeted to $84.=20\\nThe White House did not say if any other members of Mr. Bush's family had h=\\neld Enron stock. Some of his close aides did, but they were forced to dives=\\nt their holdings shortly after they joined the administration, under federa=\\nl ethics rules.=20\\nWhen Mr. Bush last spoke publicly about Enron on Jan. 11, he distanced hims=\\nelf from Mr. Lay, saying he recalled that the Texas executive had also supp=\\norted Mr. Bush's rival, Ann Richards, for governor of Texas -- and expresse=\\nd concern for Enron's workers. Mr. Bush also called for an investigation in=\\nto ''the whys of Enron,'' focusing on changing rules to protect the life sa=\\nvings of workers. But in those comments, he never criticized the company or=\\n its executives, many of whom were his political and social friends in Texa=\\ns. His tone suggested that he viewed Enron's collapse as an example of the =\\nups and downs of capitalism, rather than an effort to defraud.=20\\nToday, after a stream of revelations about the company's efforts to hide it=\\ns debts and overstate its profits, Mr. Bush seemed angry -- both at the com=\\npany and at suggestions that his administration had been unduly influenced =\\nby a major contributor.=20\\n''If somebody has got an accusation about some wrongdoing, just let me know=\\n,'' he told reporters.=20\\n''It's like when I talked with Don Evans and O'Neill,'' he said, referring =\\nto his commerce secretary and Paul H. O'Neill, the secretary of the Treasur=\\ny, ''they told me they had spoke to Enron. I said, 'Tell the people what yo=\\nu did.' ''=20\\nHe brushed aside any suggestion that Enron officials, in several meetings w=\\nith Vice President Dick Cheney and his energy task force, had influenced th=\\ne administration's energy policy. ''We laid out the energy report,'' Mr. Bu=\\nsh said. ''It's fully disclosed.''=20\\nMr. Bush called for action to prevent a recurrence of the Enron debacle, sa=\\nying, ''Our government must do something about it.''=20\\nBut he never elaborated on how oversight of companies like Enron, or their =\\naccounting firms, should change.=20\\nAnd just minutes later, addressing workers at the Walker Machinery Company =\\nhere about the economy and his campaign against terrorism, Mr. Bush returne=\\nd to one of his favorite themes: that the government overregulates the econ=\\nomy and should let up on American companies so they are freer to act as the=\\ny see fit. He said the government should ''not overregulate those who are t=\\nrying to create work.''=20\\nAs Mr. Bush spoke today, new details were emerging about shredded documents=\\n at the company's headquarters. Enron said in federal court that a second b=\\natch of shredded documents was found on Monday night in a trash receptacle =\\nat the company's headquarters.=20\\nEnron officials said they knew nothing about the destruction of the documen=\\nts and they insisted that the company had repeatedly ordered employees not =\\nto destroy documents after a series of lawsuits and federal investigations =\\nbegan looking into the collapse of the company last October and November. D=\\nestroying documents that are relevant to those investigations or to lawsuit=\\ns against the company and its executives would be a crime.=20\\nBut lawyers representing shareholders and employees said they doubted that =\\nexplanation. ''This cannot be tolerated,'' said William Lerach, an attorney=\\n in a class-action suit against Enron and Andersen, pointing to a box of sh=\\nredded Enron documents that he brought to the court hearing. ''The integrit=\\ny of the civil litigation system has been insulted.''=20\\nHe and others asked Judge Melinda Harmon of Federal District Court in Houst=\\non to seize the company's documents and put them under the guard of United =\\nStates marshals. They argued that Enron and Andersen could not be trusted t=\\no turn over valuable evidence related to the case.=20\\nThe court hearing came a day after a former Enron employee, Maureen Castane=\\nda, said that she had found a box of shredded documents on the 19th floor o=\\nf the Enron headquarters, the same floor where the company found additional=\\n evidence of shredding on Monday night. Ms. Castaneda, who was a director o=\\nf foreign exchange at Enron until she was fired last week, said she took a =\\nbox home to use the confetti as packing material. She said the box containe=\\nd shards of paper referring to some of the secret Enron partnerships that a=\\nre at the center of the accounting scandal that forced the company into ban=\\nkruptcy protection.=20\\nEfforts to reach Ms. Castaneda today were unsuccessful. The company said th=\\nat it was now cooperating with federal investigators and that company lawye=\\nrs had interviewed several workers on the 19th floor about document shreddi=\\nng.=20\\n''Until yesterday, the company believed the process was working and was com=\\npletely observed,'' Kenneth Marks, a lawyer for Enron, said today. ''We don=\\n't know what happened here. There could be completely innocent explanations=\\n for this.''=20\\nRusty Hardin, a lawyer for Andersen, criticized the opposing lawyers for dr=\\numming up publicity with television interviews Monday night, a day ahead of=\\n the scheduled hearing. Mr. Hardin said lawyers for Andersen were working h=\\nard to preserve and recover documents.=20\\n''We are not suicidal,'' he said, gesturing toward Judge Harmon. ''If we we=\\nre shredders and not preserving documents you could run us out of business.=\\n''=20\\nIn an interview today, an Enron employee who works on the 19th floor confir=\\nmed that shredded material had filled a plastic bin beside the shredding ma=\\nchine for several weeks. He said that he had never seen anyone actually doi=\\nng the shredding but that he had assumed it was taking place.=20\\n''It was obvious there was paper in the shredder,'' he said. ''Probably rec=\\nently.''=20\\nHe said the 19th floor is divided between a research division and payroll a=\\nnd accounting departments. The employee, who spoke on the condition that hi=\\ns name not be used, said he had not considered the evidence of shredding in=\\n a common room to be significant because accounting and payroll employees r=\\noutinely destroy documents.=20\\nAnd he said that while company executives had sent three e-mail messages in=\\n October outlining restrictions on shredding, he had not interpreted those =\\nmessages to be blanket prohibitions but instead were limited to documents r=\\nelated to the investigations. He said a fourth e-mail message sent on Jan. =\\n14 was emphatic that all shredding cease.=20\\nDocument shredding seems likely to be a main topic of the coming Congressio=\\nnal hearings. Tonight, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, preparing f=\\nor its hearing on Thursday on shredding of documents by Andersen, Enron's a=\\nuditors, was expected to subpoena four current or former Andersen officials=\\n: Joseph F. Berardino, the chief executive; Michael C. Odom, a partner in t=\\nhe firm's Houston office who was relieved of management responsibilities la=\\nst week; Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago headquarters; and Mr.=\\n Duncan, the lead partner on the Enron account.=20\\nMs. Temple and Mr. Odom are expected to testify willingly, but Mr. Berardin=\\no and Mr. Duncan are resisting, investigators say, and Mr. Duncan may invok=\\ne his Fifth Amendment right, they said.=20\\n''Duncan remains an extremely recalcitrant witness who believes he ought to=\\n be able to take the Fifth by fax,'' said Representative James C. Greenwood=\\n, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee that will=\\n hold the hearing. If Mr. Duncan does not at least show up to exercise his =\\nFifth Amendment rights, Mr. Greenwood said, the subcommittee would consider=\\n citing him for contempt of Congress.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But not =\\nso long ago, Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, had only nice things to say =\\nabout his auditors.=20\\nAndersen's ''expertise and professional skepticism,'' Mr. Lay explained in =\\nSeptember 2000, had helped ''improve the overall control environment within=\\n'' Enron.\\nMr. Lay made the comments in a letter to Arthur Levitt, who was then chairm=\\nan of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to persuade Mr. Levitt to bac=\\nk off on plans to improve auditor independence. Specifically, one of Mr. Le=\\nvitt's initiatives would have prohibited a company's external auditor from =\\nalso performing internal audits, as Andersen continued to do for Enron.=20\\nMr. Lay, in his letter, explained that Mr. Levitt's proposals were ''troubl=\\ning'' because Enron had found the existing setup to be cheaper and more eff=\\nicient. But, as is now understood, it is not clear that the arrangement wor=\\nked so well. In November, Enron admitted overstating its profits since 1997=\\n by nearly $600 million -- one of a series of damaging disclosures that led=\\n to its bankruptcy filing.=20\\nToday, Mr. Levitt said in an interview that the issue Mr. Lay objected to '=\\n'goes right to the heart of what we were driving at, what we were trying to=\\n eliminate.'' The most egregious conflict, he said, ''was the performance o=\\nf internal audits by the external auditor; he's auditing himself.''=20\\nHad Enron had separate auditors doing their internal and external reviews, =\\nMr. Levitt added, other auditors ''might have found something that Andersen=\\n wasn't able to uncover.''=20\\nAt the bottom of Mr. Lay's letter is Enron's trademarked motto, which, with=\\n the benefit of hindsight, is quite prescient: ''Endless possibilities.''\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Amid a sea of microphones, Mr. Lerach gave the impre=\\nssion he was leading the charge for angry shareholders in their legal battl=\\ne against Enron.=20\\nIn reality, it is a job he wants but does not yet have. Instead, Mr. Lerach=\\n, perhaps the most famous and flamboyant lawyer for shareholders, is engage=\\nd in a pitched three-way battle to be named chief legal counsel for all Enr=\\non shareholders, a job that could end up netting legal fees in the hundreds=\\n of millions of dollars for the firm selected.\\nJust who will be named chief counsel for the class-action suit will be dete=\\nrmined by a federal judge next month.=20\\nIn the meantime, Mr. Lerach is campaigning, appearing on morning talk shows=\\n and making dramatic statements to reporters on the courthouse steps as he =\\nfilled the airwaves today.=20\\nHe wants the job so badly that he has even jettisoned some clients, most fa=\\nmously, Amalgamated Bank of New York, in the hopes of staking his fortune w=\\nith even bigger ones -- one of the criteria for deciding the lead counsel.=\\n=20\\n''Bill Lerach puts himself in the forefront in terms of publicity and fees =\\nand everything else,'' said James M. Finberg, a lawyer with a San Francisco=\\n firm that is also vying to be named chief counsel. ''But the decision of w=\\nho becomes lead counsel will not be made by who has the most press attentio=\\nn, but will be made by a judge.'' His firm's clients include the City of Ne=\\nw York pension fund and a State of Florida pension fund.=20\\nIn the world of shareholder litigation, Mr. Lerach, who did not return call=\\ns for comment, is well known. He has won over a billion dollars for shareho=\\nlders in two big financial scandals involving junk bonds and savings and lo=\\nans, and brought frivolous cases like litigation over the lip-synching duo,=\\n Milli Vanilli.=20\\nMr. Lerach has made a personal fortune and gained the lasting hatred of cor=\\nporate America by bringing more than 600 suits against companies whose stoc=\\nk price has dropped. His firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, accoun=\\nts for about half of all shareholder suits against corporations and has won=\\n $6 billion for its clients.=20\\nFor this Mr. Lerach earned the name the ''king of strike suits,'' and corpo=\\nrations talk about having been ''Lerached.''=20\\nHis firm once agreed to pay $50 million to settle a case in which someone h=\\ne sued accused him of abusing the legal system and a federal jury agreed.=\\n=20\\n''He is a controversial figure of historic dimensions,'' said John Coffee, =\\na securities law professor at Columbia University. ''Those who do not like =\\nhim say he behaves as an extortionist, is threatening and shakes people dow=\\nn. Others say he is more zealous than the lazier plaintiffs' attorneys. He =\\nis the most controversial figure in a field of litigation known for its ego=\\ns and flamboyant types.''=20\\nSome say Mr. Lerach's boldest move to date may be in giving the impression =\\nin the Enron case that he already has the job he wants: ''Lerach is running=\\n around like it's his case,'' said one law school professor, who insisted o=\\nn not being identified. ''Why is this man smiling? He thinks he has the cas=\\ne, and it is not clear that he does.''=20\\nIn reality there are three legal teams vying to be selected as the lead cou=\\nnsel for the shareholders -- mainly large pension funds who bought Enron sh=\\nares, but also individual investors. Mr. Lerach's big client is the Univers=\\nity of California Regents, which has lost about $144 million. Another is Mr=\\n. Finberg's firm, Lieff Cabraser Heimann Bernstein, whose two clients, the =\\nNew York and Florida pension funds, have a combined total of $440 million i=\\nn losses and which feels it has something extra. ''We have a very sympathet=\\nic group,'' Mr. Finberg said. ''We represent a lot of the families of peopl=\\ne who died in the World Trade Center.''=20\\nA third group is composed of public pension funds from Georgia, Ohio, Washi=\\nngton and Alabama and is represented by a law firm in Delaware and one in A=\\ntlanta. This group is claiming losses of $330 million. Lawyers for the two =\\nfirms, Grant & Eisenhofer and Chitwood & Harley, did not return calls.=20\\nUnder federal securities reform legislation enacted in 1995, the criterion =\\nfor selecting a lead lawyer was changed. Rather than the firm that filed a =\\nclass-action case first (one of Mr. Lerach's specialties), the lawyer who r=\\nepresents the plaintiffs with the greatest losses, among other factors, is =\\nnow favored.=20\\nThe lead lawyer's firm decides on the legal strategy, directs all other law=\\nyers and gets the biggest slice of the fees, as well as determines how much=\\n lawyers for the other plaintiffs will be paid. These fees can run into the=\\n hundreds of millions -- the $3.2 billion class-action settlement against t=\\nhe Cendant Corporation is expected to net legal fees of over $270 million.=\\n=20\\n''The lead law firm does most of the work and gets most of the fees,'' said=\\n Brian Borders, a spokesman for the Association of Publicly Traded Companie=\\ns, which represents small and midsize companies. ''The fees in the Enron ca=\\nse could be in the hundreds of millions. It is going to be the grandaddy of=\\n all securities class-action cases and that will dictate the size of the fe=\\nes.''=20\\nAt the moment, Mr. Lerach is doing some fancy footwork to get the lead posi=\\ntion. In court today, he argued that the selection of the lead counsel shou=\\nld be changed from the law firm whose clients, as a group, suffered the big=\\ngest losses to the firm with the single client who has lost the most. By th=\\ne first calculation, Mr. Lerach's firm would be in third place.=20\\nBy the second calculation, he contends, he would be in first place, as he s=\\nays the California Regents' $144 million was the single largest loss. While=\\n the Florida pension fund lost more, $300 million, Mr. Lerach argued that F=\\nlorida should be disqualified as a lead plaintiff because it brought more c=\\nlass-action lawsuits over the last three years than allowed by federal law.=\\n But lawyers for the State of Florida say this law does not apply to instit=\\nutional investors.=20\\nTo back up his legal theory that the lawyer for the single-biggest plaintif=\\nf should get the nod, he asked his other client, Amalgamated Bank, to step =\\ndown, and the bank, with only $10 million in losses, agreed.=20\\n''This is something that we agreed to do so that Bill Lerach could become t=\\nhe lead attorney on the case,'' said Melissa Moye, chief economist for Amal=\\ngamated Bank, who reasoned that if stepping back was the only way to get Mr=\\n. Lerach selected to represent the whole class of shareholders, it would.=\\n=20\\n''We did this by mutual consent. We want the California Regents to be named=\\n as the lead plaintiff,'' Ms. Moye said.=20\\nIn fact, some see Mr. Lerach's action's today, especially his courting of t=\\nhe press, as a smart marketing move intended to draw even bigger clients to=\\n him.=20\\n''He's been courting the pension funds by saying, you ought to pick Milberg=\\n Weiss as the lead counsel,'' said Mr. Borders of the publicly traded compa=\\nnies group. ''It's all about marketing.''\\n\\nPhoto: William Lerach, a lawyer representing shareholders suing 29 current =\\nand former executives and directors of the Enron Corporation.

Since Congre=\\nss recessed a month ago, Enron and its now-fired auditor, Arthur Andersen L=\\nLP, have faced a torrent of reports alleging financial shenanigans and pape=\\nr-shredding involving both. Now, Congress watchers need a cheat-sheet to ke=\\nep track of the myriad House and Senate committees probing the mess. What f=\\nollows is a guide to those who will play lead roles.\\n-- Rep. W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin. For all of Democrats' hopes that Enron could t=\\nar the company's political favorites -- chiefly President Bush and his part=\\ny -- this Louisiana Democrat-turned-Republican so far has been the most agg=\\nressive congressional prosecutor. He has been responsible for recent disclo=\\nsures on potentially criminal document destruction.=20\\nMr. Tauzin has the right platform, as chairman of the powerful House Energy=\\n and Commerce Committee. He is inclined to use it: A savvy politician and m=\\nedia performer, he is a populist sympathetic to Main Street, not Wall Stree=\\nt, and to independent oil and gas companies rather than corporate behemoths=\\n.=20\\nA prodigious fund-raiser, Mr. Tauzin has pocketed checks from both companie=\\ns: $57,000 from Andersen since 1989, according to the nonpartisan Center fo=\\nr Responsive Politics, and $6,464 from Enron. Unlike some other politicians=\\n of late, his spokesman says he won't be returning any of it.=20\\n-- Rep. John Dingell. The pugnacious Michigander is Mr. Tauzin's Democratic=\\n opposite at the Energy and Commerce Committee. He long headed the panel, a=\\nnd sometimes acts -- and is treated -- as if he still does.=20\\n\"Big John,\" as colleagues call him, will focus on document shredding and ot=\\nher potential evidence of obstruction of justice. Also watch for him to use=\\n Enron hearings to raise longstanding concerns about the perils of energy d=\\neregulation, formerly Enron's top legislative priority, and about auditors'=\\n independence. Of Andersen's role as both Enron consultant and auditor, he =\\nsaid in an interview, \"It is impossible for any intelligent man to look at =\\nthis and not come to the conclusion that this is a serious conflict of inte=\\nrest.\"=20\\nHis take since 1989: $9,000 from Enron, $6,500 from Andersen.=20\\n-- Rep. Henry Waxman. The California Democrat has been far ahead of the pac=\\nk on Enron, though he is handicapped by being in the House's minority party=\\n -- and thus lacking the GOP chairmen's power to set hearings and subpoena =\\nwitnesses. The liberal activist set up a Web site in December for whistle-b=\\nlowers. He and Mr. Dingell triggered an investigation by Congress's nonpart=\\nisan General Accounting Office into the secret deliberations of Vice Presid=\\nent Dick Cheney's task force with energy-industry representatives -- notabl=\\ny Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay -- as Mr. Cheney drafted the administration's =\\nenergy plan.=20\\nMr. Waxman will be an interrogator on Energy and Commerce, but his own Enro=\\nn-Andersen probes have been from his perch as top Democrat on the House Gov=\\nernment Reform and Oversight Committee. His tenaciousness contrasts with th=\\ne unusually low profile of Indiana Rep. Dan Burton, the panel's GOP chairma=\\nn who was arch-inquisitor of the Clinton administration. Privately, White H=\\nouse aides have warned that Mr. Waxman could end up as \"the next Dan Burton=\\n,\" reflecting the widespread view that Mr. Burton's tenacity backfired. Dem=\\nocrats scoff.=20\\nMr. Waxman's take from the companies, according to federal records: 0.=20\\n-- Sen. Joseph Lieberman. The Connecticut Democrat gavels the opening of he=\\narings of his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee tomorrow. His celebrity=\\n is enhanced by his creditable, if losing, run for vice president in 2000, =\\nbut his motives inevitably will be viewed through the prism of 2004's presi=\\ndential politics.=20\\nMany Democrats had feared the sober centrist would be reluctant to use his =\\ninfluential chairmanship to plumb the Enron scandal; some still question ho=\\nw aggressive he will be. An early draft of Mr. Lieberman's opening statemen=\\nt suggests he will play the tough but fair \"big picture\" investigator, warn=\\ning against leaping to conclusions and focusing on what government regulato=\\nrs could have done.=20\\nMr. Lieberman has satisfied Democratic activists by vowing to press for inf=\\normation on the Cheney task force's Enron contacts. He got an assist last w=\\neekend from his committee's top Republican, Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee=\\n, who said the White House should \"get the information out.\"=20\\nMr. Lieberman received $11,500 from Andersen and $2,000 from Enron since 19=\\n89. Mr. Thompson accepted $8,800 from Andersen, according to the center's r=\\necords, and nothing from Enron.=20\\n-- Sen. Carl Levin. At the Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Levin's inve=\\nstigations subcommittee actually will take the lead in digging for insider =\\ndetails about Enron's spectacular flame-out, which culminated in the larges=\\nt U.S. bankruptcy filing ever. Mr. Levin received nothing from Enron, accor=\\nding to the center's records, and $3,200 from Andersen.=20\\nThe Michigan Democrat's panel already has sent out 51 subpoenas to Enron an=\\nd Andersen officials. Among them is one to Wendy Gramm, a member of the Enr=\\non board's audit committee and wife of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm -- the Senate'=\\ns second-largest recipient of Enron funds, with $97,350 since 1989. Mr. Gra=\\nmm's personal and political ties to Enron raised questions about his role i=\\nn coming hearings of the Senate Banking Committee, where he is the top Repu=\\nblican; yesterday, his office said he will skip hearings that focus on the =\\ncompany. The panel, led by Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, also =\\nwill be looking at financial aspects of the scandal.=20\\nSeparately, the tax-writing House Ways and Means and Senate Finance panels =\\nhave jurisdiction over a number of issues raised in the financial debacle -=\\n- and the power to probe Enron's Internal Revenue Service records. The lead=\\n actors at Ways and Means have been relatively mute. Montana Sen. Max Baucu=\\ns, the Finance chairman, this week is asking Enron to voluntarily release i=\\nncome-tax records. That move could signal the start of a fuller committee i=\\nnvestigation into Enron's use of offshore entities as tax shelters, its pre=\\nparation of tax returns, and overall compliance with federal tax laws.=20\\nMr. Baucus has taken $3,200 from Enron, but a spokesman says he will give t=\\nhe sum to a fund for Enron workers.=20\\n---=20\\nGreg Hitt and Shailagh Murray contributed to this article.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Althou=\\ngh Enron's executives and accountants have much to answer for, they can be =\\nforgiven for cracking a wry smile when members of Congress begin lecturing =\\nthem on their dereliction of duty: Congress itself, as much as Enron and Ar=\\nthur Andersen, bears some responsibility for the current state of affairs.=\\n=20\\nThe story begins in the 1970's and 1980's, when members of Congress, most f=\\nrom oil-producing states, pressured the Financial Accounting Standards Boar=\\nd and the Securities and Exchange Commission not to demand tougher standard=\\ns for financial reporting in the petroleum industry. At the time, it was cl=\\near that the lawmakers were serving corporate interests, not those of inves=\\ntors. Now it's clear that this was only a warm-up act.\\nWhile the F.A.S.B. is a private organization financed by industry, the boar=\\nd's authority comes from the S.E.C. requirement that corporations follow th=\\ne standards it sets. If Congress is unhappy with an F.A.S.B. standard, it c=\\nan pass a law directing the S.E.C. to ignore it.=20\\nFrom 1991 to 1994, members of Congress prevented the F.A.S.B. from issuing =\\na standard that would have forced companies to take a charge against earnin=\\ngs when they issue employee stock options. Congress persisted in this cours=\\ne of action even though investors like Warren Buffett and the S.E.C. itself=\\n supported the F.A.S.B.'s initiative, saying options should be counted as a=\\nn expense on earnings statements in the same way other forms of compensatio=\\nn are.=20\\nThe driving forces behind the Congressional opposition were major industria=\\nl corporations and special-interest groups representing small, high-tech co=\\nmpanies. If companies counted options as compensation, they argued, earning=\\ns would decline and stock prices would suffer. Members of both houses calle=\\nd for hearings and introduced bills that would have hamstrung the F.A.S.B. =\\nin its attempt to bring clarity to this important issue. In fact, in 1994, =\\n88 members of the Senate voted for a ''sense of the Senate'' resolution in =\\nwhich they informed the F.A.S.B. that its proposed standard would have ''gr=\\nave economic consequences'' for entrepreneurial ventures.=20\\nAt one point in the debate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connectic=\\nut and now chairman of the committee that will convene tomorrow's first hea=\\nring, introduced a bill that would have effectively destroyed the F.A.S.B.'=\\ns authority to set standards for financial reporting. The bill, proposed as=\\n an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, would have required t=\\nhe S.E.C. to vote on every statement issued by the board. In the face of th=\\nis proposed legislation, the F.A.S.B. had no choice but to drop its proposa=\\nl to amend the way options are accounted for.=20\\nIn the 1997-1998 session, the F.A.S.B. tried to rewrite the rules affecting=\\n derivatives, financial devices whose worth is determined by the value of a=\\nnother entity, whether it be government bonds, pork bellies or, as was the =\\ncase with some of Enron's derivatives, the price of natural gas. Derivative=\\ns are complicated and risky, and the F.A.S.B. in its new rules sought to en=\\nsure that corporate financial statements accurately reflected those risks. =\\nThis time, in the face of opposition from members of both parties in Congre=\\nss, the F.A.S.B. was able to withstand the pressure. It issued its new stan=\\ndards in 1998.=20\\nBut adversity quickly followed this minor success. In the 1999-2000 session=\\n, members of Congress once again intervened, this time to place barriers in=\\n the path of proposed standards on mergers and acquisitions and the way cor=\\nporations involved in them account for the value of intangible assets like =\\ngood will. The F.A.S.B. had wanted to change the way companies account for =\\nsome costs in such deals, forcing them to write them off over a shorter per=\\niod of time. Companies opposed the change, saying the increased costs would=\\n reduce their earnings, and lobbied Congress against the change. In the fac=\\ne of such opposition, once again the F.A.S.B. was required to make a strate=\\ngic retreat.=20\\nYet the true cost of all this Congressional meddling is even greater than t=\\nhe sum of its parts. Taken collectively, these proposed standards would hav=\\ne merely tweaked the existing accounting model. What is necessary is a comp=\\nrehensive overhaul of the model itself. The model was designed for the indu=\\nstrial era. It worked fine when plants, equipment, inventories, accounts re=\\nceivable -- stuff you could see and touch -- were what made a company tick.=\\n It fails miserably when the critical resources of a firm are software, int=\\nellectual capital, brand names and fiscal wizardry.=20\\nFew accountants will deny that the F.A.S.B. was unable to close accounting =\\nloopholes as rapidly as Enron and Andersen created them. And few will deny =\\nthat fast and loose reporting practices are all too common in the corporate=\\n world.=20\\nYet Congress has not allowed even a modest tweaking. Imagine, then, the out=\\ncry if the F.A.S.B. actually got serious about true reform of the current a=\\nccounting model. Among the changes it might propose are restoring to the ba=\\nlance sheet many liabilities, like certain kinds of leases, that are now co=\\nnsidered ''off balance sheet''; adjusting reported earnings for changes in =\\ncurrent prices of assets; and recognizing and amortizing the many intangibl=\\ne assets that are currently not even seen on balance sheets.=20\\nEach of these changes could have helped regulators and investors see the En=\\nron-Andersen debacle coming, or even helped to prevent it. By sending a mes=\\nsage that such changes are not remotely welcome or politically possible, Co=\\nngress paved the way for the current crisis. Congressional involvement in f=\\ninancial standard-setting has been pure politics, fueled by a system of cam=\\npaign financing that distorts the pursuit of the nation's legislative agend=\\na. If members of Congress are sincere about identifying and correcting weak=\\nnesses in the standards used for financial reporting, then they should inve=\\nstigate the old-fashioned way: follow the money. They are likely to find a =\\ntrail that leads to the nearest mirror.\\n\\nDrawing (Milan Trenc)=20\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The SEC, which has proposed revamping oversight of t=\\nhe accounting industry, is investigating Arthur Andersen LLP's auditing of =\\nEnron's books and disclosures that the accounting firm shredded documents r=\\nelated to its work on behalf of the energy company, which has filed for ban=\\nkruptcy.\\nMs. Glassman, a Republican, has worked at Ernst & Young since 1997 and was =\\nthe firm's director of commercial-bank risk management for two years.=20\\nPerhaps trying to lessen Democrats' ire, Mr. Bush reappointed Isaac Hunt, w=\\nho was originally appointed by former President Clinton in 1996.

Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Tuesday that he will not take p=\\nart in congressional investigations into Enron's collapse, but will join th=\\ne discussions about what should be done to avoid similar debacles.=20\\n\"I'm not going to recuse myself on issues that are relevant to all business=\\n,\" said Gramm, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee.=20\\nThat panel, chaired by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., plans to hold a hearing F=\\neb. 12 to examine accounting and retirement investment issues raised by Enr=\\non's collapse.=20\\nMany current and former Enron employees lost their life savings because the=\\nir 401(k) retirement plans were wholly invested in Enron stock.=20\\nLawmakers will examine proposals that would force participants in retiremen=\\nt plans to diversify their portfolios.=20\\nSuch issues, Gramm said, \"are not Enron-specific.\"=20\\nSarbanes agrees that Gramm should be able to take part in committee activit=\\nies, a spokesman said.=20\\nBut some critics contend Gramm will not be able to draw the line neatly bet=\\nween Enron issues and those that apply to all businesses.=20\\n\"He should recuse himself, given that his wife is on the board and his wife=\\n, potentially, could be in serious trouble,\" said Tyson Slocum of consumer =\\nactivist Ralph Nader's Public Citizen.=20\\nAs a member of the audit committee with strong government and academic cred=\\nentials, \"she's got some serious explaining to do,\" added Slocum, who serve=\\ns as research director for Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Enviro=\\nnment Program.=20\\nLarry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a se=\\nlf-styled government watchdog group, said he doesn't know how Gramm can avo=\\nid creating at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.=20\\nEven when discussing issues such as accounting changes and 401(k) retiremen=\\nt rules, Noble said, \"Enron is going to be the 3,000-pound elephant sitting=\\n in the middle of the room.\"=20\\nWendy Gramm first joined Enron's board in 1993, just weeks after stepping d=\\nown as head of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While at t=\\nhe commission, she had championed deregulation of commodities trading, incl=\\nuding energy.=20\\nThe Gramms contend they have separate business lives and do not discuss suc=\\nh work-related concerns at home.=20\\n\"We talk about my taking out the garbage and Texas A&M football,\" Phil Gram=\\nm said.=20\\nBack in 1998, Wendy Gramm sold $207,000 in stock -- her entire Enron holdin=\\ngs -- and asked the company to pay her for her board work in cash payments =\\nto a deferred-compensation plan, rather than in Enron shares.=20\\nThe idea was to eliminate any conflict-of-interest problems, so that her hu=\\nsband could freely participate in the debate over the nation's energy polic=\\ny.=20\\nWendy Gramm sold that stock, her husband points out, before Enron's stock p=\\nrice rocketed up in 1999 and 2000. Her deferred-compensation fund is now ti=\\ned up in the Enron bankruptcy.=20\\nThe conflict-of-interest issue resurfaced in December 2000, when lawmakers,=\\n with Sen. Gramm's blessing, approved the Commodity Futures Modernization A=\\nct.=20\\nThat bill essentially codified regulations pushed at the Commodity Futures =\\nTrading Commission as far back as 1989, when Wendy Gramm was a member. The =\\nmeasure exempted energy and metals commodities trading from government regu=\\nlation.=20\\nThe language of interest to Enron, Sen. Gramm noted, was written by lawmake=\\nrs in the House. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which had jurisdiction o=\\nver that portion of the bill, did not change the House language.=20\\nGramm, at that time chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, objected to t=\\nhe bill because of some banking provisions he found unacceptable. Under the=\\n rules of the Senate, Gramm held up progress on the bill for four months.=\\n=20\\nWendy Gramm, who heads a regulatory studies program at George Mason Univers=\\nity in Virginia, had done her own critique of the Commodity Futures Trading=\\n Commission's work and raised separate objections to the legislation.=20\\nSen. Gramm does not remember being lobbied directly by Enron on the Commodi=\\nty Futures Modernization bill, although he was aware of a letter Enron Chai=\\nrman Ken Lay had written to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., in Septem=\\nber 2000, urging passage of the measure. The bill, Lay wrote, would provide=\\n \"critical legal certainty\" for Enron's commodity-trading businesses.=20\\nEventually, Gramm and the Clinton administration reached a compromise on th=\\ne banking provisions and the measure was attached to a spending bill.=20\\n\\nAuditor Independence: The SEC Chairman Doesn't Get It\\nBy Roger Lowenstein\\n\\n01/23/2002\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nA22\\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt doesn't get it. \"Au=\\nditor independence is not the cause of the problems that we are witnessing,=\\n\" Mr. Pitt insisted recently. The \"problems,\" of course, refer to Enron, an=\\nd \"the bigger issues\" in that unhappy saga relate to \"the quality of our di=\\nsclosures, the penetrability [or lack thereof] of financial reports.\"=20\\nNo doubt about it, Mr. Pitt, Enron's reports were lacking in quality and im=\\npenetrable to boot. And anyone who took weeks or months to plough through t=\\nhem would have figured it out. Especially if they had access to Enron's boo=\\nks, had been party to explanations on how its affiliated partnerships relat=\\ned to the mothership, and had maybe gotten invited to dinner at Ken Lay's h=\\nouse.\\nBut most of us in the public didn't. That's why we rely on public accountan=\\nts to audit financial statements and certify that they are in keeping with =\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.=20\\nWhat principles Arthur Andersen was following lord only knows. But the firm=\\n that blessed not only Enron's books but also Waste Management's and Sunbea=\\nm's has somewhere in its employ auditors who can tell right from wrong and =\\nquality from its opposite. If auditors have the right incentives they will =\\ndo so.=20\\nMr. Pitt, who in private practice represented, among others, Arthur Anderse=\\nn, and who, in general, never saw a government action he didn't find worthy=\\n of challenging, says now that he doesn't want to throw armies of lawyers a=\\nnd bucketfuls of taxpayer money at \"every problem.\" Nor does he desire new =\\nlegislation. All that is needed is an outside monitoring group and better d=\\nisclosure.=20\\nIndeed, the beauty of disclosure, which lies at the heart of our system of =\\npublic markets, is that it does the work of cops better (usually) than legi=\\nons of investigators. Just as a street thug is unlikely to commit a mugging=\\n in a well-lit park, a corporate criminal won't often steal if he knows his=\\n actions will soon be disclosed.=20\\nThe question is who shines the lamp on corporate activity and -- just as im=\\nportant -- who makes sure that the beacon does not resort to a lampshade at=\\n inconvenient moments? In Enron's case, managers had the audacity to report=\\n $425 million of net income in the first quarter of 2001 -- a period in whi=\\nch it also reported cash flow from operations of negative $464 million.=20\\nThis bald disparity between cash flow, which is virtually impossible to man=\\nipulate, and reported earnings was a clear red flag that something was amis=\\ns. Andersen, from its own memos at the time, knew it -- and let it go.=20\\nEnron has been widely compared to Long Term Capital Management, the bond-tr=\\nading hedge fund that imploded in 1998. But it is the contrast between the =\\ntwo that is illustrative. It demonstrates the difference between problems s=\\npawned by poor judgment and those involving conflicts of interest -- in Mr.=\\n Pitt's phrase, \"auditor independence.\"=20\\nAt first blush, the two cases seem much alike. Both LTCM and Enron were big=\\n, complex and secretive. LTCM's traders cut their teeth in financial deriva=\\ntives, when those markets were new, inefficient and ripe with opportunity. =\\nEnron, somewhat similarly, was a pioneer in energy derivatives.=20\\nOver time, and largely thanks to LTCM's success, bond arbitrage became crow=\\nded and hedging opportunities narrowed, leading LTCM to branch into new are=\\nnas, including equities. Enron, similarly, forged into virgin markets, incl=\\nuding fiber-optic bandwidth, data storage and snow protection for ski resor=\\nts -- the latter reminiscent of LTCM's monster trade in \"equity volatility\"=\\n (stock market insurance). Each firm was held in awe by investors and credi=\\ntors and by legions of worshipful admirers until -- quite suddenly -- it co=\\nllapsed.=20\\nBut these similarities shouldn't blind us to the fact that Enron and LTCM w=\\nere wholly dissimilar in their degree of moral culpability. LTCM's results,=\\n when the firm was making money, were genuine, and its traders were the big=\\ngest losers in the firm's downfall. That they went down with the ship tells=\\n us they genuinely believed in the product.=20\\nEnron's managers, on the other hand, unloaded bucketfuls of stock even whil=\\ne they were publicly touting it. That's why a criminal investigation is war=\\nranted, and why conflict of interest is at the heart of the Enron case.=20\\nEnron's managers had to know -- indeed, were warned -- that their accountin=\\ng was highly, highly dubious. Had they feared an accounting in the Biblical=\\n sense they never would have tried to report such \"results\" -- which, of co=\\nurse, have since been reversed. What made them so certain of Andersen's pro=\\ntection?=20\\nFor one, Andersen was co-opted by the $27 million it was paid by Enron for =\\nother, non-audit work and by the reasonable expectation that more such grav=\\ny would follow. There is an easy solution to this particular conflict: ban =\\nit. Enron should not be able to otherwise pay off the firm that is supposed=\\nly serving as the guardian of its integrity.=20\\nMr. Pitt belittles the problem, saying that auditors are conflicted anyhow,=\\n just by the fees they receive for audits. Who wants to anger the client by=\\n being a pain in the neck and lose the job for next year?=20\\nBut again, the chairman misses the point. Auditors don't work for managers;=\\n they work for the directors. Hiring and firing auditors is solely up to th=\\ne audit committee of the board. But owing to the consulting-type payoffs An=\\ndersen received and, more seriously, long cultural tradition, auditors beha=\\nve as though the client is management.=20\\nThis problem is deeply embedded in our corporate culture. It is why executi=\\nves at top corporations from General Electric on down routinely try to \"man=\\nage\" their earnings and why their auditors routinely help them. If auditors=\\n understood that their true client is the board -- and through it, the inve=\\nsting public -- they would see that their interest is in disclosing a true =\\npicture, not a prettified one.=20\\nBut this sort of cultural change is never easy -- in this case only a total=\\n overhaul can get the job done. We need an independent watchdog with legisl=\\native teeth, not the administrative wand-waving proposed by Mr. Pitt. In sh=\\nort, Congress should create a body that could set standards in public audit=\\ning and would also have real disciplinary and enforcement powers to monitor=\\n public auditors.=20\\nMr. Pitt can still undo the harm from his comment that \"there is nothing ro=\\ntten with the accounting profession.\" None less than his boss, George W. Bu=\\nsh, found a new sense of purpose -- an enlarged appreciation for his job an=\\nd for the meaning of leadership -- when events interrupted what had seemed =\\nto be a placid era.=20\\nHarvey Pitt, this is your Afghanistan.=20\\n---=20\\nMr. Lowenstein is the author of \"When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of L=\\nong-Term Capital Management\" (Random House, 2001).\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But that would be a huge leap for thinly staffed agencies that usually s=\\npend their time administering Certified Public Accountant exams and discipl=\\nining local accountants who have been convicted of crimes. The agencies hav=\\ne no ability to pursue criminal charges, but can pursue civil penalties thr=\\nough an administrative-law procedure.\\nIn Texas, where Andersen fired its lead auditor for Enron last week for ove=\\nrseeing document destruction, the State Board of Public Accountancy has ope=\\nned an inquiry to determine whether \"possible misdeeds, omissions or malfea=\\nsance\" took place. State Rep. Steven Wolens, who requested the investigatio=\\nn, said if the board recommends the revoking of Andersen's permit, that wou=\\nld have \"a domino effect. All the eyes would be on New York and California =\\nto act next.\"=20\\nAlready other states, including Connecticut and Illinois, have begun their =\\nown investigations. Other states also may be taking action, but state profe=\\nssional regulation laws generally prohibit disclosure of pending matters. D=\\navid Costello, president of the National Association of State Boards of Acc=\\nountancy, has said state boards \"throughout the U.S. are vigilantly trackin=\\ng\" reports about Enron and Andersen. Governors typically appoint board dire=\\nctors who then hire permanent staff.=20\\nMichael Kozik, an attorney with the Connecticut State Board of Accountancy,=\\n wouldn't say whether the states were working together. \"We have opened a f=\\nile and we are starting to explore the legal and accounting issues involved=\\n,\" he says. The matter was initiated at the request of state Attorney Gener=\\nal Richard Blumenthal, who said in a letter to the board that the state and=\\n its citizens already have suffered \"serious and possibly irretrievable fin=\\nancial losses.\" A state pension fund and agency lost a combined $235 millio=\\nn.=20\\nMeanwhile, attorneys general from Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Alabama hav=\\ne asked the U.S. District Court in Houston to name them lead plaintiffs in =\\na nationwide class-action lawsuit against Enron and Andersen. The four stat=\\nes' retirement pension boards lost a combined $331 million because of the c=\\nollapsed value of Enron's stock and bonds. Other states could join as membe=\\nrs of the class.=20\\nAmid this case and myriad other investigations, can the Texas accountancy b=\\noard -- an agency with five lawyers (the state attorney general can help ou=\\nt in major cases) and a $550,000 investigation budget intended to resolve c=\\nomplaints \"emphasizing voluntary compliance and education\" -- realistically=\\n be expected to build its own case?=20\\n\"I think they will be absolutely overwhelmed,\" says Wayne Shaw, an accounti=\\nng professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \"Almost always wha=\\nt you see is them going after an individual already convicted of something,=\\n or investigating a one- or two-person firm. They have never had to deal wi=\\nth anything like this. I don't think they have the structure or expertise t=\\no deal with this.\"=20\\nWhile Mr. Wolens's letter directs the board to investigate the Big Five acc=\\nounting firm, Mr. Shaw says it is more likely the board will focus on a han=\\ndful of Andersen auditors. Andersen lawyers so far have taken steps to sepa=\\nrate the Chicago firm from the activities of its Houston office, which hand=\\nled the Enron account.=20\\nWilliam Treacy, executive director of the state board, declines to comment =\\non the Andersen matter, but says \"we have the necessary resources to invest=\\nigate and prosecute cases of a major nature.\"\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Paltrow and Jonathan Weil\\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n01/23/2002\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nA2\\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nThe accounting industry's Public Oversight Board, which oversees auditors' =\\n\"peer review\" method of self-regulation, unexpectedly voted itself out of e=\\nxistence, a move that at least temporarily would leave no mechanism in plac=\\ne for policing audits of public companies.=20\\nThe board's chairman, Charles A. Bowsher, said the abrupt move was meant as=\\n a protest to plans announced last week by SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt to devi=\\nse a new body that eventually would replace the oversight board in monitori=\\nng the industry.\\nThe announcement, which caught the Securities and Exchange Commission and t=\\nhe Big Five accounting firms by surprise, comes as the accounting industry,=\\n in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse, faces unprecedented criticism for f=\\nailing to supervise itself effectively amid repeated failure by auditors to=\\n detect major accounting irregularities.=20\\n\"We thought that in the public interest we just had to speak up\" by voting =\\nto shut down, said Mr. Bowsher, adding that \"it just isn't true\" that Mr. P=\\nitt's proposal would increase independent oversight of auditors.=20\\nThe oversight board, founded in 1977, reviews and must approve the peer rev=\\niews accounting firms do of one another. Its staff also investigates \"faile=\\nd audits\" in which auditors failed to ferret out companies' violations of a=\\nccounting rules. The system has been heavily criticized because no large ac=\\ncounting firm has ever been given an unfavorable review. Mr. Bowsher had ar=\\ngued that the board could have been a much more effective regulator if the =\\nindustry had allowed it to have real powers to demand records and impose di=\\nsciplinary measures on firms.=20\\nThe five-member board voted unanimously to \"terminate its existence\" no lat=\\ner than March 31. The decision was made in a telephone meeting of the board=\\n on Sunday, but was announced yesterday. Although Mr. Pitt has announced br=\\noad outlines of his plan for a new body with stronger powers to discipline =\\nthe industry, no formal proposal has been drawn up. If the oversight board =\\nshuts down as planned, that threatens to leave the industry without an over=\\nseer of audits at least for several months.=20\\nMr. Bowsher said the board felt that Mr. Pitt's plan, rather than increasin=\\ng independent oversight of the profession, actually would tighten accountin=\\ng firms' control. For example, he noted, the proposal is for a new board th=\\nat would have a large minority of its members from the accounting industry.=\\n The five members of the current oversight board are prominent people from =\\nthe business world who have no direct ties to the big accounting firms. In =\\na letter to Mr. Pitt notifying him of the board's decision, Mr. Bowsher als=\\no faulted Mr. Pitt for holding a series of private meetings in recent weeks=\\n with officials of the Big Five accounting firms and the industry's trade a=\\nssociation, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, before =\\nhe announced his plan on Jan. 17.=20\\nThe AICPA and Big Five firms were Mr. Pitt's clients while he was in privat=\\ne legal practice before he became SEC chairman.=20\\nMr. Bowsher said the SEC and AICPA have contacted him asking whether the bo=\\nard would reconsider its decision. He said the board will listen to their p=\\nroposals but \"I would be surprised if we reversed our decision.\"=20\\nIn a letter to Mr. Bowsher today, Mr. Pitt said the new regime he envisions=\\n would have a role for the oversight board and said, \"The issues, I think, =\\nare too important for the POB simply to walk away.\"=20\\nKPMG LLP said, \"We believe it's irresponsible for the Public Oversight Boar=\\nd simply to resign.\"=20\\nA spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP confirmed that chief executives =\\nof the Big Five firms, including Pricewaterhouse, had held a series of priv=\\nate meetings with Mr. Pitt in Washington between Dec. 4 and Jan. 17.

Early in the=\\n day they fell as low as $8.40.=20\\nAlthough EOTT itself isn't part of the Enron bankruptcy, Enron's inability =\\nto pay on past promises will hurt EOTT in several ways.=20\\nOne of the Enron subsidiaries in Chapter 11, Enron Gas Liquids, has a long-=\\nterm contract to sell products for EOTT that can't be honored, which increa=\\nses its exposure to price swings.=20\\nAdditionally, Enron can't make up a 22.5-cents-per-unit shortfall on EOTT's=\\n cash distribution for the fourth quarter, which leaves holders considerabl=\\ny short of the 47.5 cents they were promised. The period that ended Dec. 31=\\n was the last quarter for this arrangement.=20\\nEOTT announced Tuesday that the cash distribution for the quarter will be 2=\\n5 cents. It will make a claim for Enron's 22.5 cents in bankruptcy court.=\\n=20\\nThis further weakens earnings at a time when slumping crude oil prices are =\\nshrinking the profit margins on the approximately 350,000 barrels per day t=\\nhe company handles.=20\\nEOTT officials warned that earnings for 2001 will be below the earlier esti=\\nmates of 90 cents to 94 cents per unit, while declining to elaborate or to =\\nprovide estimates for 2002.=20\\nOn Tuesday, Moody's placed EOTT's credit ratings under review for a possibl=\\ne downgrade.=20\\n\"The first weak quarter in two years for our marketing and transportation b=\\nusiness comes at the worst possible time,\" said President and Chief Executi=\\nve Officer Dana Gibbs.=20\\n\"Although our uncommitted credit lines continue to meet our immediate worki=\\nng capital and supplier credit needs, cash requirements over the next sever=\\nal months are at a historic high, and Enron's bankruptcy has significantly =\\nimpacted the partnership's financing alternatives,\" he said in a written st=\\natement.=20\\nThe company won't disclose more until its fourth-quarter results are releas=\\ned in the latter half of February, Gibbs told analysts in a conference call=\\n.=20\\nEnron is \"a large part of its problems\" said analyst David LaBonte of Salom=\\non Smith Barney.=20\\nThe publicly traded partnership is independent, but Enron is still the gene=\\nral partner. LaBonte of Salomon Smith Barney said in an earlier analysis th=\\nat he expects the general partnership interest to be put up for sale.=20\\nIncluded are the $117 million purchase last year from Enron of an MTBE plan=\\nt plus liquefied natural gas pipeline and storage facilities.=20\\nPart of the deal was a 10-year \"tolling agreement\" with Enron. With this ty=\\npe of arrangement EOTT receives a fixed fee, with Enron serving as a middle=\\nman who doesn't use the MTBE or handle natural gas liquids. MTBE is a key c=\\nhemical used in gasoline formulas in areas with pollution problems, like Ho=\\nuston.=20\\nThe bankrupt Enron Gas Liquids dropped out of the agreement, so EOTT began =\\nmarketing the MTBE itself Nov. 29. This exposes the company to swings in th=\\ne marketplace, said Gibbs.=20\\nOn the storage side there are problems as well. Enron Gas Liquids has the s=\\nole right to lease the facilities and until this is resolved EOTT can't neg=\\notiate with third parties, he added.=20\\nEOTT plans to take a $30 million noncash charge to write down the value of =\\nthese tolling and storage agreements.=20\\nEnron was also supposed to foot the bill to convert the MTBE plant to one t=\\nhat makes a different additive if the Environmental Protection Agency decid=\\nes to phase out MTBE, said an analyst who asked not to be identified.=20\\nThere was also speculation that EOTT may have overpaid for these facilities=\\n, which will be written down on the next financial report.=20\\nFinally, suppliers who are concerned about Enron's bankruptcy have been req=\\nuiring more letters of credit from EOTT.

The company responded by hiring the former boss of a leading staff of=\\nficial at the Securities and Exchange Commission to represent it in negotia=\\ntions with the agency. In an unheralded five-paragraph order in March 1997,=\\n the S.E.C. official, Barry P. Barbash, gave Enron's foreign operations a b=\\nroad exemption from the law -- the Investment Company Act of 1940.=20\\nHow Enron came to get its exemption from the severe restrictions of the law=\\n clearly illustrates the ways the company lobbied Washington and the respon=\\nse by the regulatory system. That system was devised during the Depression =\\nto protect investors and customers of utilities from a wide range of corpor=\\nate abuses that investigators think ultimately took place at Enron.=20\\nBoth Congress and the S.E.C. are reviewing the exemption to the Investment =\\nCompany Act and earlier exemptions that were given to the company by the ag=\\nency, including a 1993 exemption from the tough restrictions imposed by the=\\n Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.=20\\nExperts say that the S.E.C. rulings unshackled the company from significant=\\n accounting restraints and business dealings between the Enron companies an=\\nd their executives. The 1997 exemption, in particular, cleared the path for=\\n the company to both expand overseas and make greater use of the special pa=\\nrtnerships that have caused the company so much turmoil.=20\\n''From a regulatory standpoint, this raises a flag,'' said Joseph V. Del Ra=\\nso, a former official at the S.E.C. in the 1980's and an expert on the Inve=\\nstment Company Act. ''It gave them carte blanche to go all over the world a=\\nnd set up subsidiaries and affiliated entities that would have been prohibi=\\nted under the act.''=20\\nAnother expert on the act, Mark A. Sargent, the dean of the Villanova law s=\\nchool, agreed.=20\\n''The Enron structure was not a single company with stockholders engaged in=\\n operations like an ordinary corporation,'' he said. ''It was similar to an=\\n investment company with investments in a bunch of different companies. The=\\n decision to exempt those from the kind of protections to investors is now =\\ncoming home to roost.''=20\\nArthur Levitt, who was the chairman of the S.E.C. when the 1997 exemption w=\\nas granted, said today that he had no recollection of it. But he said it co=\\nuld be a potentially significant part of the agency's role in failing to ov=\\nersee Enron.=20\\n''It may be one of those cases of the nail in the shoe of the horse,'' he s=\\naid. ''It may be one of those things that seemed insignificant at the time =\\nbut can wind up being determinative.''=20\\nMr. Barbash, the lawyer at the S.E.C. who approved the exemption, said in a=\\nn interview this week that he viewed the exemption as narrow because it app=\\nlied only to the foreign operations of Enron and some of its subsidiaries. =\\nHe said that it was successful in that it managed to head off Enron's effor=\\nts to have a broadly worded exemption written into the law ''that companies=\\n could have then driven trucks through.''=20\\n''Enron knew the regulatory boxes, and they tried to fashion their business=\\nes to fall outside of those boxes,'' Mr. Barbash said. ''Much of what's bee=\\nn written so far about the company is that it turned itself inside out like=\\n a pretzel to fall outside of restrictions -- accounting restrictions, taxp=\\nayer restrictions and regulatory restrictions.''=20\\nAnother former S.E.C. official who is an authority on the Investment Compan=\\ny Act, was more critical.=20\\n''This was a case of giving Enron an inch and they took miles,'' said the f=\\normer official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''They were given =\\na significant new opportunity, and they took it and flew it smasho into the=\\n ground.''=20\\nMark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, did not return a call seeking comment.=20\\nMr. Barbash, who at the time was director of the investment management divi=\\nsion at the S.E.C., said that Enron's lawyers came to him in 1996 after the=\\n company had failed to persuade Congress to grant the company broad exempti=\\non to the 1940 law.=20\\nEnron and several of its subsidiaries said they needed the exemption becaus=\\ne their foreign operations were quickly taking on the characteristics of in=\\nvestment companies. The act, which regulates mutual funds and other kinds o=\\nf investment companies, generally applies to companies that hold at least 4=\\n0 percent of their assets in securities that are passive investments and no=\\nt controlling interests.=20\\nA lawyer who represented Enron said that although the company and its forei=\\ngn subsidiaries had actually controlled many of their overseas ventures, li=\\nke power plants, they were unable to have a 51 percent stake in them becaus=\\ne of local rules and political constraints.=20\\nIn 1996, Congress rewrote parts of the act but refused to grant an exemptio=\\nn to Enron because of significant opposition from both the S.E.C. and the I=\\nnvestment Company Institute, the main trade organization for the mutual fun=\\nd industry and a strong supporter of the law. Mr. Barbash said that in 1996=\\n, Congressional aides advised Enron's lawyers to seek an exemption directly=\\n from the agency.=20\\nThe company decided to retain Joel H. Goldberg, a former director of the in=\\nvestment management division at the S.E.C., who said today that he did not =\\nknow how the company came to hire him.=20\\nAn Enron official said the company had retained Mr. Goldberg knowing that h=\\ne had previously been Mr. Barbash's boss and was his predecessor at the S.E=\\n.C. Mr. Goldberg had been Mr. Barbash's supervisor at the S.E.C. in the 198=\\n0's and the Labor Department in the 1970's. The two lawyers are now partner=\\ns at the international law firm of Shearman & Sterling.=20\\nMr. Goldberg said he viewed the exemption as a narrowly tailored one intend=\\ned to permit the company to continue its overseas projects. But he acknowle=\\ndged that had the company not been granted the exemption, it would have bee=\\nn constrained from using any partnerships or shifting debt off the books in=\\n its foreign operations.=20\\n''I guess on the one hand, if they had been subject to the Investment Compa=\\nny Act, they probably could not have done these transactions,'' he said. ''=\\nThe subsidiaries would not have existed, and they would have had to make an=\\nother plan.''\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron's collapse, Berardi=\\nno said, was a result of a bad business plan. \"It failed because the econom=\\nics didn't work.\"\\nBoth statements may very well be true. But they're hardly reassuring. Quite=\\n the opposite, in fact. The less illegality found in the Enron debacle, the=\\n more chilling the picture becomes for investors.=20\\nJust look at what Enron, often with the blessing of Andersen, managed to ac=\\ncomplish, apparently within the comfortable confines of today's laws:=20\\n* For nearly five years, Enron inflated earnings by a total of almost $600 =\\nmillion. This \"legal\" practice forced investors to make decisions about the=\\n value of Enron's stock using bogus profit figures.=20\\n* Using off-the-books partnerships and maddeningly opaque accounting, with =\\nAndersen's approval, Enron shielded about $500 million in debt. That helped=\\n keep Enron's credit rating high, but at the expense of misleading anyone f=\\noolish enough to trust the numbers coming from the company and the private =\\ncredit-ratings agencies.=20\\nTo be sure, at least one high-level Enron official tried to do the right th=\\ning, raising concerns with Enron's CEO Kenneth Lay about the company's acco=\\nunting practices. And some Andersen officials expressed concern about Enron=\\n's now-famous \"partnerships\" and how Enron was crunching its numbers back i=\\nn February 2001. Even some stock analysts openly puzzled over how Enron mad=\\ne its money.=20\\nBut since everything looked legal on paper, those asking pointed questions =\\nwere ignored. On Sept. 26, Lay was urging employees to buy company shares, =\\ntelling them it was an \"incredible bargain\" and emphasizing that Andersen h=\\nad signed off on the off-the-books partnerships. Just 20 days later, Enron =\\nannounced a substantial third- quarter loss and a $1.2-billion drop in shar=\\neholder equity.=20\\nAndersen continued to OK Enron's books. And stock analysts were busy toutin=\\ng its stock right up to the bitter end. As late as Oct. 25, all but two of =\\n17 analysts were giving Enron stock a thumbs-up.=20\\nEven if the nation's laws weren't so permissive, Enron very well may have m=\\net the same end. In a free-market economy, no business is guaranteed a succ=\\nessful future. But Berardino's defense that he couldn't find any illegality=\\n among all of these acts provides little solace to the thousands of Enron e=\\nmployees and countless investors who banked on Enron and Andersen for hones=\\nt numbers and lost billions. Had everyone involved used an ethical compass,=\\n rather than a strictly legal one, investors would have been armed with acc=\\nurate information about Enron's business and the risks it entailed when dec=\\niding whether or not to buy its stock.=20\\nIf investors and workers are to be spared calamitous surprises in the futur=\\ne, merely passing a raft of new legislation won't solve the problem. A chan=\\nge of attitude about what is acceptable in executive suites and on accounti=\\nng desks is at least as vital.\\n\\nPHOTO, B/W, Alex Wong, Meet the Press, via Reuters; Caption: Joseph Berardi=\\nno: CEO of Arthur Andersen talks about Enron's collapse Sunday on NBC's Mee=\\nt the Press.=20\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron's problem was bad assets =\\nof a conventional variety: a power plant in India, utility and pipeline inv=\\nestments in Brazil, a waterworks in Britain, unused and inoperable telecomm=\\nunications assets in this country.\\nTraditional accounting would have required the company to mark down its cur=\\nrent earnings to cover the declining value of these assets. Instead, Enron =\\nchose to avail itself of a dodge, creating outside partnerships to buy the =\\nassets at list price. Banks put up the money, but the loans were secured wi=\\nth promises of Enron stock, and if the stock price fell, with promises of c=\\nash. That is, shareholders were still on the hook for the bad assets but th=\\ney didn't know it.=20\\nThe standard view, that Enron executives were simple crooks, tends to overl=\\nook that they were also the company's biggest individual shareholders. If t=\\nhese were crooks, they were dumb crooks.=20\\nWe might understand, though not approve, if Ken Lay were sitting on a beach=\\n in the Bahamas now, his purloined millions in an untraceable Cayman Island=\\n bank account. But when the normally dexterous and astute Mr. Lay is handed=\\n a loaded gun and manages to shoot off most of his toes before the gun is t=\\naken away from him, then the questions get really interesting.=20\\nWe've seen the same scenario with other companies that weren't nearly so fa=\\nmous for political connections. Cendant almost imploded after it was found =\\nto have falsely accounted for its customer acquisition costs. Sunbeam under=\\n Al Dunlap shipped unwanted barbecue grills to shopkeepers and called them =\\nsales. These cases (and many like them) had nothing to do with deregulation=\\n or campaign finance yet they are of a single species with the Enron disast=\\ner.=20\\nOne can readily imagine what went through executives' minds: The assets wil=\\nl bounce back. Our new trading ventures will grow so fast as to dwarf the l=\\nosses when we eventually are obliged to recognize them.=20\\nThe company had big plans for brokering advertising time, Internet bandwidt=\\nh and other imagined \"new economy\" commodities, none of which were working =\\nout as quickly as hoped. In accounting logic, though, a theory can trump a =\\nfact if you believe hard enough, and Enron was full of believers (as news t=\\nhis week of Mr. Lay's soured investments in other new economy wonders shows=\\n).=20\\nWorse, margins were eroding in Enron's core energy trading business. As we =\\nnoted last June, revenues had quadrupled in a year but profits were up only=\\n 31% -- a sign that the business was going backward and would be in bad sha=\\npe if revenues didn't keep growing spectacularly.=20\\nUnfortunately, even the quadrupling was largely a function of idiosyncratic=\\n conditions in California, which were soon reversed. The sad truth is that =\\nEnron's business was maturing. There would be no great profusion of new ear=\\nnings to make up the losses. Enron's accounting gamble had come a cropper. =\\nThe roof finally fell in when the stock plummeted, causing lenders to deman=\\nd cash Enron didn't have.=20\\nWhy Enron did what it did may, in some sense, be unknowable, but two factor=\\ns seem to explain why high-growth companies in particular find it hard to t=\\nake cognizance of dimming prospects.=20\\nThe Wall Street factor: Enron ran into the dilemma that comes to companies =\\nwhose share prices reflect extravagant hopes about the future that prove un=\\nfounded -- how do you let the air out of your own stock? Our legal system a=\\nnd the ethos of shareholder capitalism make it very hard for companies to d=\\no that, so some stretch accounting logic in an attempt to protect the share=\\n price.=20\\nThe psychological factor: Ken Lay's name may be mud among Enron employees n=\\now, but an earlier generation remembers him as a decent guy and irrepressib=\\nle visionary. But as the Rebecca Mark episode seemed to demonstrate, he had=\\n a weakness for the meteoric personalities in his midst. Ms. Mark was the b=\\nombshell and livewire who led the company's investment in the Dabhol power =\\nplant in India, which turned into a political and financial disaster, and t=\\nhen its foray into the water business, which became another disaster.=20\\nEverything we've learned about Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's protege and the =\\nwunderkind CEO who mysteriously resigned last August, suggests he was anoth=\\ner personality that Mr. Lay fell in love with. He moved Enron into losing i=\\nnvestments in fiber-optic bandwidth and other new markets, and oversaw the =\\ndebt-hiding strategy. When Enron's share price began unraveling, he claimed=\\n outlandishly that investors should be willing to pay twice the share price=\\n for Enron's shrinking earnings.=20\\nNotice that we don't mention a lack of regulation or the need for campaign =\\nfinance laws. Harrumphing in Washington won't stop the occasional Enron fro=\\nm falling off the edge.=20\\nAccountants are right when they say accounting conventions haven't kept up =\\nwith the world. Most of a company's value these days resides in assets not =\\nmeasured on a balance sheet, such as management's alertness to opportunity =\\n(which many saw as Enron's chief virtue). Indeed, an irony that will surely=\\n escape Congressional sleuths is that Enron wouldn't have failed if investo=\\nrs had not rewarded it with an excessively optimistic stock price in the fi=\\nrst place.=20\\nThe fact is, as trading becomes cheaper and as investors diversify their ri=\\nsks with mutual funds, the public's appetite for risk has been growing stro=\\nnger. We push companies to live more dangerously now, to roll the dice on i=\\nnspired innovation. That's why we dangle large stock rewards in front of ma=\\nnagements: to overcome their bias in favor of caution and self-protectivene=\\nss.=20\\nThe Enron hearings can serve a useful purpose if they foster a realistic vi=\\new of the new, quicksilver corporate order. For instance, high-risk, high-r=\\neward, eggs-in-one-basket stock incentives are an excellent tool of behavio=\\nr of modification when aimed at top executives, who can affect a company's =\\nshare price with every decision. They make no sense for the average employe=\\ne, who can't.=20\\nThe typical worker is already exposed enough to his firm's fortunes through=\\n his job.

KILBORN\\n\\n01/23/2002\\nThe New York Times\\nPage 6, Column 1\\nc. 2002 New York Times Company\\n\\nBALTIMORE, Jan. 22 -- People were thinking about the safety of their 401(k)=\\n retirement funds long before the fall of Enron -- the drop in the stock ma=\\nrket over the last two years had assured that.=20\\nBut the Enron collapse, in which many of the company's employees lost their=\\n retirement savings, has moved people, including those having lunch at Jimm=\\ny's Famous Seafood Restaurant here, to take action.\\n''I've got an appointment Wednesday to talk with the representative at Metr=\\nopolitan Life,'' said Pam, a Baltimore school system employee, who declined=\\n to give her full name. Sitting at another table was Roxanne, a state port =\\nemployee, who also refused to give her last name. ''I've got plans to meet =\\nwith my financial adviser to talk about diversity,'' she said.=20\\nAcross the country, from the docks of this industrial city, to Detroit, Chi=\\ncago, Denver and Silicon Alley, people who once boasted of 20 percent year-=\\nby-year increases in their 401(k) retirement plans are on the move. They ar=\\ne making appointments with brokers and their human resources offices, rewor=\\nking their portfolios and shifting money from the market's fallen stars. Th=\\ney are allocating more of their money to safer fixed-income securities and =\\nblue chip stocks -- companies that retain some of their trust.=20\\nDonald Clarke, 56, a senior electrical engineer at Bethlehem Steel, was hav=\\ning Jimmy's sour beef and dumplings plate. The Enron scandal, he said, shou=\\nld put all investors on alert. ''All companies try to put a rosy picture on=\\n themselves for the stockholders,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''But they're still su=\\npposed to be truthful. Enron wasn't.''=20\\nReports of the collapse of Enron employees' 401(k) accounts are stirring pa=\\nrticular scrutiny of employers that require investment in their own stock. =\\n''That's something that I'm really going to look into when I find my next j=\\nob,'' said Sue Becker, 51, of Evanston, Ill., who recently left a job with =\\na food processing company. ''That would definitely be a question I would as=\\nk in the interview.''=20\\nMichael Sachs, 28, a lawyer at Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal in Chicago wh=\\no has $12,000 to 15,000 in a 401(k) account, agreed. ''I'd be asking that q=\\nuestion,'' he said.''=20\\nPaul Colwell, a history teacher at Lincoln Park High School outside Detroit=\\n, said Enron ''makes me wonder about some of the companies I'm invested in.=\\n''=20\\nMr. Colwell added: ''What have they been doing? Are they as solid as I thou=\\nght they were?''=20\\nLinda Schultz, 46, of Rosemont, Ill., works for Sears, Roebuck & Company in=\\n Chicago. Like Enron employees, she is required to hold stock in her compan=\\ny and has 30 percent of her 401(k) in Sears stock. Unlike Enron employees, =\\nher stock is worth something: at about $54 a share, it is far above the $15=\\n Ms. Schultz paid when she began working at Sears 24 years ago.=20\\nBut in this climate she said she would get rid of the stock if her retireme=\\nnt plan permitted her to. Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has don=\\ne work for Sears in the past, Ms. Schultz said. ''People started wondering =\\nabout what was going on with us, and they started getting nervous. You just=\\n don't know what's going to happen with the company.''=20\\nSome investors have thicker skins. Rory MacDonald, 53, who said he works fo=\\nr a ''worldwide big deal oil and gas company'' he wouldn't name, was taking=\\n a cigarette break in Denver's 16 Street Mall. He said his 401(k) account p=\\nlunged $100,000 last year.=20\\nMr. MacDonald, who plans to retire at 63, said he considered directing the =\\naccount into less volatile securities but did not change anything. ''I expe=\\nct before my 10 years are up and I retire, the stock market will go back up=\\n and I will recoup that loss,'' he said.=20\\nAt Jimmy's, Mr. Clarke was having lunch with Terry Moore, 58, an engineer w=\\nho retired from Bethlehem in 1994 after 30 years with the company.=20\\nExcept for the apparent corruption, they said, Enron has nothing on Bethleh=\\nem, which has also filed for bankruptcy protection.=20\\n''Bethlehem was 48 cents today,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''When I started buying =\\nit, it was about $35 a share.'' The decline has meant a $70,000 loss in his=\\n retirement account.=20\\nBefore dumping it all, Mr. Moore made money with his Bethlehem stock. ''I b=\\nought and sold, bought and sold,'' he said, and managed to get his timing r=\\night.=20\\nUnlike the many workers whose only retirement fund is a 401(k) account, Mr.=\\n Clarke and Mr. Moore also have fixed-benefit pensions, financed entirely b=\\ny the company, that ensures them a monthly check of a fixed amount througho=\\nut their retirements. Mr. Moore collects about $2,000 a month, about $600 l=\\ness than he would have received had he not retired early.=20\\nBut those plans, are not as safe as they seem. ''They can change it in a he=\\nartbeat,'' Mr. Moore said. If Bethlehem was shut down, the government would=\\n pick up the pension plan but reduce the benefit.=20\\nFor Barbara Friedman, who was having lunch at Jimmy's, Enron signifies the =\\nend of an era. ''Two years ago the market was fun,'' said Ms. Friedman, 59,=\\n whose two grown children are invested in sunken 401(k) plans. ''Win or los=\\ne, it was fun. Now it's not fun.''=20\\nAs she paid her check, she continued. ''It isn't just Enron,'' she said. ''=\\nYou had all these high-flying stocks. The worst thing was how attuned we be=\\ncame to those investment managers and television pundits, hanging on their =\\nevery word. That trust has gone.''\\n\\nPhoto: Enron has raised concerns of a number of workers, including Harold G=\\noodman, left, and Donald Clarke, who discussed 401(k) plans over lunch yest=\\nerday in Baltimore.

Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's ambitious chairma=\\nn and chief executive, who last year said he was aiming for $100 billion in=\\n revenues by 2006. Now, Tyco is worth at least 50% more broken up than as a=\\n whole, he said. While saying that Tyco's accounting practices are spotless=\\n, Mr. Kozlowski told investors that separating the company into smaller, in=\\ndependent entities will offer investors \"greatly increased simplicity, clar=\\nity and transparency.\"=20\\nMr. Kozlowski declared: \"A lot of companies are going to suffer for Enron's=\\n sins.\" But he said his spinoff wasn't planned in reaction to the recent dr=\\nop in Tyco's stock price. Rather, he said, for the past 18 months or so, Ty=\\nco executives have been frustrated by the low ratio of the company's stock =\\nprice to its earnings, even as the company has continued to deliver strong =\\nearnings growth.=20\\nTransparency was exactly what some investors believed was lacking at Tyco, =\\nwhose chief businesses include security gear, medical products, and financi=\\nal services. The company's acquisitions, while generally regarded as well e=\\nxecuted, made its financial statements increasingly difficult to analyze. A=\\ncquired companies disappeared into much bigger Tyco units, making their sub=\\nsequent performance impossible to track. Some smaller acquisitions were nev=\\ner even announced.=20\\nTyco's breakup marks the latest sign that investors and regulators are dema=\\nnding more clarity from companies' disclosures to the public. In the wake o=\\nf the Enron debacle, jittery investors have been fleeing any stock with eve=\\nn a whiff of accounting controversy. When a wave of fresh accounting rumors=\\n about Tyco started soon after Jan. 1, the company's shares tumbled nearly =\\n25% in less than three weeks, wiping almost $30 billion from its market val=\\nue. That created profits for short sellers, whose trading strategy bets on =\\na stock's decline.=20\\n\"Enron and others have really shaken things up, and it's provided fuel for =\\nshorts who have been all over [Tyco] for years,\" said Bruce Bartlett, direc=\\ntor of growth investing at Oppenheimer Funds, which owns about 5.5 million =\\nshares of Tyco in eight different mutual funds. Mr. Bartlett said he doesn'=\\nt believe any of the buzz about possible accounting problems at Tyco. But i=\\nnvestors, he said, \"hate stories that don't have accounting transparency.\"=\\n=20\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday reminded public companies =\\nof the need to clearly disclose financial transactions, including off-balan=\\nce-sheet financings, in their forthcoming annual reports. Enron used such a=\\nrrangements to keep large amounts of debt off of its books. There is no sug=\\ngestion, even from Tyco's critics, that it has employed off-balance-sheet f=\\ninancing or secret partnerships.=20\\nMoody's Investors Service, the big credit-rating agency, has made an unusua=\\nl demand of more than 4,000 bond issuers: to provide new information on any=\\n off-balance-sheet arrangements that could pose financial risks.=20\\n\"We need better disclosure about these matters in this reporting season,\" S=\\nEC Chief Accountant Robert K. Herdman said in the commission's statement. H=\\ne urged companies to exceed minimum legal disclosure requirements and also =\\nsaid the SEC is continuing to study how it can improve disclosure of esoter=\\nic financial arrangements.=20\\nAuditing firms also are clearly feeling pressure from the very public pillo=\\nrying of Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. That harsh spotlight is \"stiffe=\\nning the spines of auditors in other companies,\" said James Gipson, lead ma=\\nnager of Clipper Fund, a mutual fund with about $2.5 billion in assets. \"Au=\\ndits taking place right now are likely to be very diligent, much more so th=\\nan they were a year or two ago,\" he said. \"In the long run, investors will =\\nbe well served by that.\"=20\\nProfessional investors say they are stepping up their own vigilance because=\\n of the Enron meltdown. \"We are paying more attention to\" companies' more c=\\nomplex financial engineering, said Steve Fossel, a portfolio manager and vi=\\nce president with Berger LLC, a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc. While Berge=\\nr has always made an effort to analyze such arrangements, recent events hav=\\ne moved that \"more toward the front of your mind,\" he said.=20\\nTyco's announcement last week of results for its fiscal first quarter, whic=\\nh ended Dec. 31, provided a prime example of what some investors have calle=\\nd the company's preference for baffling disclosures. The results featured t=\\nhree separate changes in accounting practices and a \"pro forma\" section on =\\nhypothetical year-earlier earnings. There were also numerous charges and cr=\\nedits Tyco treated as extraordinary, even though some are considered part o=\\nf operating results under generally accepted accounting principles.=20\\nAlthough the accounting-practice changes were adopted to conform with recen=\\nt changes in general standards, even some accounting professors were left s=\\nhaking their heads at the complexity of the results.=20\\nMeanwhile, the Bermuda-registered Tyco has also been lowering its taxes and=\\n interest costs through a complex international structure that, in part, in=\\nvolves issuing debt through a Luxembourg subsidiary. Befuddled investors ha=\\nve found themselves wading through numerous lengthy footnotes in an attempt=\\n to decipher all of this. Some wonder how Tyco has been able to report 40% =\\naverage annual growth in per-share earnings over the last five years with a=\\n grab-bag collection of businesses, ranging from disposable diapers to home=\\n-alarm systems.=20\\nTyco's response has been that it chooses the right businesses to acquire, c=\\nuts costs to maximize efficiency and provides generous incentives to keep i=\\nts managers at the top of their game. It has also said that its free cash f=\\nlow -- which it put at $4.8 billion last year -- demonstrates the integrity=\\n and authenticity of its earning power.=20\\nUntil the Enron scandal, questions about Tyco's accounting seemed to have s=\\nubsided. An SEC investigation of its merger-related accounting ended in 200=\\n0, when the SEC essentially cleared the company, and the stock had recovere=\\nd.=20\\nMr. Kozlowski said Tyco executives began seriously considering a breakup mo=\\nre than a year ago but didn't move forward with it until he began informall=\\ny approaching some directors last month. The company then engaged Goldman S=\\nachs & Co. to analyze a potential breakup. The final decision took place at=\\n a two-day board meeting in Bermuda that ended Monday. \"We didn't just wake=\\n up a week ago and say, `Hey, the stock is going down. Let's break up the c=\\nompany,\" the Tyco chief said.=20\\nUnder the plan to separate the company into four parts, the security and el=\\nectronics units, with $17.6 billion in 2001 revenue, will form the core of =\\na slimmed-down Tyco run by Mr. Kozlowski. Three other units -- a finance su=\\nbsidiary, a health-care business, and a unit making fire-protection devices=\\n and \"flow-control\" equipment, such as valves and pipes -- will each be spl=\\nit off into a new company. As much as 20% of each new company will be sold =\\nin initial public offerings.=20\\nAfter the IPOs, Mr. Kozlowski said Tyco plans to spin the remainder of the =\\nthree companies out to shareholders by the end of 2002. In addition, Tyco p=\\nlans to sell its plastics unit, which Mr. Kozlowski predicted could bring $=\\n3 billion to $4 billion. If all goes as planned, Tyco plans to eliminate $1=\\n1 billion of its $23 billion in debt, excluding obligations of its finance =\\narm.=20\\nInvestors reacted cautiously to the breakup plan, pushing Tyco shares up ju=\\nst $1.10, to $47.55, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. T=\\nhat's still far below the nearly $59 level at which Tyco started 2002, and =\\nwell short of Mr. Kozlowski's prediction that the breakup plan would add 50=\\n% in value for investors.=20\\nDon MacDougall, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, praised Tyco's plan, estimatin=\\ng the breakup value of the company at $90 a share. Mr. MacDougall said inve=\\nstors will be eager to snap up shares in the IPOs, especially of the compan=\\ny's health-care business, a Wall Street favorite these days. That business =\\nmakes medical products such as sutures, syringes, and diagnostic-imaging su=\\npplies.=20\\nMr. MacDougall said dividing the company into smaller pieces should allay i=\\nnvestor suspicion about Tyco's complexity, because each segment will disclo=\\nse far more detailed information. \"Acquisitions at Tyco created financial s=\\ntatements that are far more complex than the average company's,\" he said. T=\\nhat depressed Tyco's share price, he added. \"We've long felt that discount =\\nis inappropriate.\"=20\\nBut some investors reacted more skeptically. Kevin McCloskey, a portfolio m=\\nanager at Federated Investors Inc. in Pittsburgh, which owns 4.3 million Ty=\\nco shares, said the plan could deliver higher share prices, but he added, \"=\\nI have to question whether this is the time to give up on their [prior] str=\\nategy.\" He said he suspects that Tyco executives were afraid they wouldn't =\\nbe able to meet their own earnings projections, and with the stock price so=\\n low, couldn't make new acquisitions. \"So they come up with Plan C, which i=\\ns split up the company,\" he said.=20\\nPiloting the audacious breakup plan through his board in just a month is ch=\\naracteristic behavior for Mr. Kozlowski, the son of a Newark, N.J., detecti=\\nve who joined Tyco as assistant controller in 1976. After running three div=\\nisions, he took the reins as chief executive in 1992. The company then had =\\n$3 billion in annual revenue from such operations as valves, pipes and fire=\\n-sprinkler systems. By last year, he had expanded revenue 12-fold, gobbling=\\n up scores of companies along the way, including ADT alarm systems, AMP ele=\\nctrical connectors and U.S. Surgical.=20\\nIn making deals, Mr. Kozlowski insists on a simple formula: Tyco doesn't do=\\n hostile deals, and every acquisition has to add to earnings immediately. O=\\nnce Tyco acquires a firm, it cuts costs, sometimes ruthlessly. On the same =\\nday in 1999 it bought Batts Inc., a family-run maker of plastic hangers, Ty=\\nco executives stunned the company's employees by announcing the closure of =\\nall three factories in its Michigan hometown. Tyco executives said the clos=\\nures helped integrate Batts into its other hanger operations.=20\\nTyco is highly decentralized, run from a simple, two-story wooden building =\\nin Exeter, N.H., staffed with top executives and a few dozen accountants, l=\\nawyers and acquisition specialists. Unit managers are given considerable le=\\neway -- and paid handsomely for delivering results. During much of the 1990=\\ns, the formula was a spectacular success, with the stock rising more than 1=\\n2-fold between the day Mr. Kozlowski took the helm and early October 1999.=\\n=20\\nThat was about the time the first serious questions about Tyco's accounting=\\n arose. The concerns were aired in a newsletter, published by Dallas money =\\nmanager David Tice. Mr. Tice claimed that Tyco had a history of taking huge=\\n acquisition-related charges that could be used to pump up profits later. H=\\ne also warned that investors weren't paying enough attention to the charges=\\n, which he said were obscuring the company's actual results.=20\\nTyco executives hotly disputed the allegations, but its stock took a steep =\\nfall after the SEC began an informal inquiry into the company's accounting =\\npractices. In mid-2000, after Tyco made some minor adjustments in restating=\\n its books, the SEC ended its inquiry without taking any action. Bullish in=\\nvestors saw that as vindication of Tyco's bookkeeping.=20\\nAfter the SEC inquiry ended, Tyco kept chugging along, delivering a 42% inc=\\nrease in per-share earnings in fiscal 2000, before what Tyco called restruc=\\nturing and other \"non-recurring\" items, and another 29% increase on a simil=\\nar basis last year. But the stock didn't take off as Tyco executives hoped.=\\n Instead, it bounced up and down with the market. It closed yesterday below=\\n its October 1999 level, prior to Mr. Tice's report.=20\\nTyco executives believe they have been victimized, in part, by short seller=\\ns, who try to profit from a stock's decline by selling borrowed shares in h=\\nopes of replacing them with shares bought later at a lower price. The compa=\\nny has been a favorite of the shorts, who have contended that Tyco's number=\\ns are simply too good to be believed.=20\\nFor starters, Tyco critics have said the company has been improving its per=\\nformance by having acquired companies take inflated writeoffs and otherwise=\\n manipulate their books in their last few months of independence before bei=\\nng gobbled up by Tyco. This period typically isn't subject to any scrutiny =\\nby outsiders because the acquired company usually doesn't file financial st=\\natements for the period.=20\\nFor example, some cite a series of charges by finance company CIT Group Inc=\\n. last year in the two months before it was acquired by Tyco. CIT posted a =\\nnet loss of $78.8 million in its final two months of independence, when inv=\\nestors didn't much care. Then, after being absorbed by Tyco, it posted net =\\nincome of $71.2 million in the remaining month of its June quarter. Tyco ex=\\necutives have said the accounting was proper, and that they told investors =\\nthat CIT's one-month results were artificially high owing in part to large =\\nquarter-end revenue.=20\\nOthers have noted Tyco's seemingly uncanny ability to keep lowering its tax=\\n rate, especially in quarters in which it needs extra income. In last year'=\\ns fourth quarter, the company reported a tax rate of just 19.2%, down from =\\n24.7% for the first nine months, and 24.2% in the year-earlier period. Tyco=\\n has said it had overestimated its tax rate earlier in the year and had to =\\nadjust it in the fourth quarter. The lower rate added about five cents per =\\nshare to earnings in a quarter in which it beat analysts' expectations by t=\\nwo cents.=20\\nEven many veteran money managers have said Tyco's financial statements have=\\n been so complex that they didn't understand them fully. Alfred Harrison, a=\\n manager of Alliance Premier Growth Fund in New York, which has $12 billion=\\n in assets, including Tyco shares, said recently that \"nobody knows how the=\\ny put it together, but they do.\" Mr. Harrison likened Tyco's complexity in =\\nsome senses to Enron, saying \"to some degree, they become faith stocks.\"=20\\nWhen that faith started to diminish in recent weeks, Mr. Kozlowski vowed th=\\nat he would no longer use Tyco stock to make acquisitions. With the company=\\n shouldering $23 billion in debt -- mostly from prior deals -- many wondere=\\nd how Tyco would be able to keep gobbling up companies. The fear was that w=\\nithout dealmaking, the company's growth would begin to falter.=20\\nMr. Tice, the Dallas money manager, said yesterday's announcement suggested=\\n a repudiation of the company' strategy of growing through serial acquisiti=\\nons, financed with a rising stock price and growing debt levels. \"This is e=\\nssentially Tyco's dream exploding,\" he said. \"The company always wanted to =\\nget big -- to grow -- not break up.\"=20\\nAbout a month and half ago, Mr. Tice also started shorting Tyco shares in h=\\nis Prudent Bear mutual fund. He said he did so in part because he believed =\\ninvestors were starting to grow more skeptical of companies with obscure fi=\\nnancial statements. \"We just felt like earnings would slow down and that th=\\nere would be more concern about accounting issues after Enron,\" he said.=20\\nMr. Kozlowski denied any \"defensive\" reason for the breakup plan, saying th=\\ne company was on track to make its earnings targets for this year. He said =\\nTyco would deliver $5.5 billion next year in free cash flow -- a measure tr=\\nacked by many Tyco analysts and investors, who consider it a key indicator =\\nof earnings quality. Mr. Kozlowski also said Tyco had no reason to be conce=\\nrned about its debt, which was low considering the size of its total balanc=\\ne sheet.=20\\nBut at some point, the Tyco chief said, investors were going to start clamo=\\nring for a breakup. Instead of waiting two or three years to prove to skept=\\nical investors that its model works, he decided on the breakup plan. Someti=\\nmes, he added, \"you just have to pull the trigger and do it.\"\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith\\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n02/01/2002\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nA1\\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nHOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a =\\nmeeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultim=\\nately disastrous course.=20\\nOn that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a t=\\nurn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly ille=\\ngal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a=\\n management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=\\nrantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.\\nWhile Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=\\ns was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=\\nas supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=\\nned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20\\nEnron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=\\nhe meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=\\ntow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=\\nld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =\\nlimited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =\\nbut off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=\\nnough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20\\nHowever, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,=\\n there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=\\nas. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=\\nsively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=\\nlders and creditors.=20\\nFour years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=\\nng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About=\\n two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=\\ncause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able=\\n to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that=\\n Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=\\nrs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=\\nt bankruptcy-law protection.=20\\nFederal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=\\nrn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=\\nd themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=\\ns existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never=\\n heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=\\nnda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about=\\n a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=\\n, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20\\nJeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=\\nmer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=\\nut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, \"We are=\\nn't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation.\" An atto=\\nrney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=\\nly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20\\nThe meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =\\npeople at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=\\nrt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =\\nOne -- Herbert \"Pug\" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=\\neenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =\\ncreation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20\\nW. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,=\\n says the executive committee was told that \"Chewco was a special-purpose v=\\nehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=\\n-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=\\nas involved with Chewco.\" The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =\\nin attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=\\now whether he was introduced or took part.=20\\nDuring the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow \"=\\nreviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=\\norporate structure.\" Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=\\nng was \"positive income impact to Enron,\" according to a handout appended t=\\no the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=\\nture.=20\\nChewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =\\nlongtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =\\nhis firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =\\nseparate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=\\nng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =\\nBarclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the=\\n transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=\\nh the discussions.=20\\nA Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =\\nis scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by=\\n his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=\\no four years ago.=20\\nChewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had=\\n at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as=\\n had many competitors. Traditional \"off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=\\nnique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=\\nted States,\" says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial=\\n firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =\\ndeveloping, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=\\noney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20\\nThis financing is \"nonrecourse,\" meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=\\ne hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=\\nh it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=\\n. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =\\nlittle of it publicly evident.=20\\nTo do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=\\nlowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=\\ntnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=\\nhe assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since=\\n 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=\\nst 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=\\nsoring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for=\\n many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=\\nrship.=20\\nEnron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=\\nuilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.=\\n consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital=\\n and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=\\nenants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=\\nnd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20\\nThey figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=\\nth debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =\\nits financing costs higher.=20\\nMr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =\\nand deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=\\nther \"hard\" assets. The traditional partnership approach was too cumbersome=\\n and confining to achieve this. Enron would have to negotiate for months wi=\\nth partners, banks and other outsiders before getting a deal going. \"Enron =\\ndidn't like being told no,\" says one former senior Enron executive. So Mr. =\\nSkilling and Mr. Fastow \"found a way to avoid the discussion altogether.\"=\\n=20\\nThe solution: bring the partnerships in house, without appearing to do so, =\\nsay people involved in setting up the structures.=20\\nIn 1995, according to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Fastow began app=\\nroaching investment banks with a novel proposal. He wanted them to help him=\\n recruit investors for partnerships that would do business with Enron. But =\\nthe partnerships would be partly owned and run by Enron executives. Donalds=\\non, Lufkin & Jenrette, for one, turned him down, figuring the potential con=\\nflicts of interest were too great.=20\\nMr. Fastow and other Enron officials continued their discussions with vario=\\nus banks to no avail. All the while, pressure was building. By 1997, compan=\\ny executives would later acknowledge, debt levels were getting worrisomely =\\nhigh. The company was also having a tough time meeting its earnings project=\\nions.=20\\nThat's when Chewco was presented to the board in the November 1997 meeting.=\\n Having met resistance from investment banks, Enron officials turned to com=\\nmercial banks to lend money to Chewco as well as to two small entities, als=\\no connected to Mr. Kopper. These two put the crucial 3% of outside equity i=\\nnto Chewco that allowed it to be treated as separate from Enron.=20\\nAfter Chewco was set up, Enron's profit performance began to improve and it=\\ns expansion pace intensified. Mr. Skilling and his team ascended the ranks.=\\n By 1998, he was Enron's chief operating officer, Mr. Fastow was chief fina=\\nncial officer and Mr. Causey was chief accounting officer.=20\\nChewco became a template. In June 1999, the board held a special meeting to=\\n hear Messrs. Skilling and Fastow outline plans for a new partnership known=\\n as LJM Cayman LP. It was designed to resolve \"certain challenges\" in prote=\\ncting the value of a growing portfolio of volatile telecommunications asset=\\ns, according to an excerpt from the meeting's minutes. The LJM name came fr=\\nom the initials of Mr. Fastow's wife and two children.=20\\nFour months later, the Enron executives proposed to the board an even more =\\nambitious partnership, dubbed LJM2 Co-Investment LP, to serve as a reposito=\\nry for other risky bets made by the company.=20\\nBoth LJMs were managed and partly owned by Mr. Fastow. In an SEC filing, En=\\nron recently estimated he made more than $30 million from his participation=\\n in the entities. At least several million dollars of this was management f=\\nees -- a generous sum given that, in one presentation, Mr. Fastow said he w=\\norked just three hours a week on partnership matters.=20\\nA spokesman for Mr. Fastow declines to comment on how much he made from the=\\n partnerships or on LJM generally. In the past, representatives of the form=\\ner CFO have pointed to Enron statements that its board and top management r=\\neviewed and approved both the creation and operation of the LJM partnership=\\ns.=20\\nSome Enron insiders say that whatever Mr. Fastow earned from the LJM partne=\\nrships was a pittance compared with the benefits they provided the company.=\\n As Enron's growth exploded in the late 1990s, worries mounted over debt le=\\nvels, and the company needed help producing cash flow and earnings. Increas=\\ningly, Enron came to rely on the partnerships to take debt and troubled ass=\\nets off its books and produce transactions that could be reported as profit=\\ns. How much Mr. Fastow made from the LJMs was of little concern to top mana=\\ngement, says one former Enron executive, because the CFO was the one person=\\n who could consistently pull \"their nuts out of the fire with some fancy tr=\\nansactions.\"=20\\nBy the year 2000, the LJM partnerships were providing more than 40% of Enro=\\nn's reported pretax income of about $1.4 billion, according to a recent SEC=\\n filing by the company.=20\\nAll told, the LJM partnerships raised about $400 million from outside inves=\\ntors and eventually did billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. Sub=\\nstructures of the LJM latticework proliferated with the creation of other e=\\nntities. In a May 1, 2000, presentation to the finance committee of Enron's=\\n board, management described how an LJM offshoot called Project Raptor woul=\\nd \"hedge the profit & loss volatility of Enron investments,\" according to i=\\nnternal documents from that meeting.=20\\nAs part of the project, another entity called Talon was to be created with =\\nseed capital of $400 million and an initial capacity to provide \"approximat=\\nely $200 million of P&L protection\" to Enron, according to one document. LJ=\\nM2 would be the outside investor in Talon and \"be entitled to a 30% annuali=\\nzed return plus fees,\" it said.=20\\nAt the finance-committee meeting, its minutes show, Mr. Causey said Anderse=\\nn \"had spent considerable time analyzing the Talon structure and the govern=\\nance structure of LJM2 and was comfortable with the proposed transaction.\" =\\nThe committee approved the Raptor-Talon plan.=20\\nMr. Causey's attorney, J.C. Nickens, says that his client believes the trea=\\ntment of the partnerships \"was an appropriate interpretation of the account=\\ning rules as they existed then and as they still exist today.\"=20\\nThough the minutes said there was \"discussion\" of the Raptor arrangement, n=\\neither those minutes nor similar recountings of other board gatherings indi=\\ncate that directors seemed particularly concerned about what was happening =\\nunder the LJM umbrella. They might well have been. By last fall, public con=\\ncern over the transactions had plunged Enron into crisis. Now, investigator=\\ns are trying to make sense of hundreds of other Enron-related entities with=\\n names like Braveheart, Rawhide and Bobcat. The big question: Which, if any=\\n, may contain LJM-like problems?=20\\n---=20\\nJohn R. Wilke contributed to this article.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The committee is holding hearings Mond=\\nay at which former Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay is expected to give his fi=\\nrst public account of the company's collapse.

Written minutes from meetings of the company's bo=\\nard of directors suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's g=\\nrowth strategy and show that they were regularly reviewed by the board.=20\\nThe partnerships are a major focus of investigators trying fathom what led =\\nto Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, which came less than a month after Enr=\\non disclosed that since 1997 financial statements audited by the big accoun=\\nting firm Arthur Andersen had overstated Enron's profits by almost $600 mil=\\nlion and understated its debts by more than $1 billion.=20\\nA dozen congressional committees, as well as the Justice Department and the=\\n Securities and Exchange Commission, are probing Enron's demise, which cost=\\n investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is w=\\nhether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partner=\\nships run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20\\nDorgan said that as of yesterday evening, Fastow has failed to respond to r=\\nepeated requests to testify before the senator's subcommittee. He said that=\\n Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, has said he will appe=\\nar, but not on Monday.=20\\nFastow and Skilling are scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Com=\\nmerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations next Thursday.

OPPEL Jr.\\n\\n02/01/2002\\nThe New York Times\\nPage 1, Column 2\\nc. 2002 New York Times Company\\n\\nWASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Enron has refused to turn over to a Senate panel rec=\\nords of controversial partnerships that are crucial to understanding the co=\\nmpany's downfall, the panel's chairman said today.=20\\nThe chairman, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, said that despite repeated requests,=\\n Enron continued to refuse to turn over records of 3,000 partnerships. Inve=\\nstigators say Enron used the arrangements to bolster the company's financia=\\nl statements while hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.\\n''They just simply have not cooperated,'' Mr. Dorgan said, adding that ''th=\\ne shroud of secrecy that surrounds so much of what this corporation has don=\\ne will not be allowed to stand.'' But he did not say whether the committee =\\nwas considering a subpoena.=20\\nMr. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the consumer affairs=\\n subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said lawyers for Kenneth L.=\\n Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, assured his staff on Wed=\\nnesday that Mr. Lay would appear on Monday to testify before Congress. His =\\nlawyers have not sought immunity for the testimony, Mr. Dorgan said.=20\\nMr. Dorgan also said another former Enron chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skill=\\ning, had agreed to testify in coming weeks. But he said the company's forme=\\nr chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who Enron says made more than =\\n$30 million from his dealings with the partnerships, has not responded to r=\\nepeated registered letters asking him to testify. A spokesman for Mr. Fasto=\\nw declined comment today.=20\\nLate today, another Congressional committee investigating Enron's downfall,=\\n the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said both Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fa=\\nstow would testify next Thursday, along with Enron's chief accounting offic=\\ner, Richard A. Causey; its chief risk officer, Richard B. Buy; and the boar=\\nd of directors' audit committee chairman, Robert K. Jaedicke. A former Enro=\\nn executive who was involved in the partnerships, Michael Kopper, has also =\\nbeen subpoenaed to appear.=20\\nA lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, disputed Mr. Dorgan's characterizati=\\non of the company's cooperation, saying the senator had been ''terribly mis=\\ninformed.''=20\\n''We have been fully cooperative with that committee,'' Mr. Bennett said. '=\\n'There are some documents that the committee would like to get that we have=\\n no access to and no control over, and I believe that may be what is raisin=\\ng this issue. But he is getting bad information.''=20\\nAt the Senate hearing on Monday morning, Mr. Lay, who was ousted from his j=\\nob by Enron's creditors last week, is expected to testify that important de=\\ntails of the partnerships and investments were kept from him and the board.=\\n=20\\nMany investigators doubt his claims of ignorance, and Mr. Lay may be presse=\\nd about why he sold millions of dollars of Enron stock last year even as he=\\n promoted the value of the shares to Wall Street and his own employees. Min=\\nutes of Enron board meetings also show that Mr. Lay was present when the pa=\\nrtnerships were discussed. Mr. Lay's lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, declined comm=\\nent today, but in the past he has said that Mr. Lay was disposing of stock =\\nlast year to pay down loans outside the company and that the sales did not =\\nreflect any doubts about Enron's future.=20\\nToday, Mr. Dorgan said investigators had received 41 boxes of materials fro=\\nm Enron, which he declined to characterize. But he did say it was clear tha=\\nt members of the company's board had a fair degree of knowledge about the d=\\neals.=20\\nSome people involved in the Congressional investigations had thought Mr. La=\\ny was unlikely to testify before first reviewing a long-awaited report by a=\\n special committee of Enron directors into the company's deals with the par=\\ntnerships.=20\\nPeople close to the company said the report was expected to be finished som=\\netime over the weekend. Before being released publicly, the report would ha=\\nve to be approved by the special committee and then have to be reviewed by =\\nthe full board.=20\\nThe report is likely to draw distinctions about how much various people at =\\nEnron, including board members, Mr. Lay and other executives, knew concerni=\\nng the partnerships, and how much responsibility various officials bear, a =\\nperson close to the matter said. The report may also say board committees h=\\nad differing levels of information about the deals, this person said.=20\\nIn an interview today, Mr. Dorgan said he intended to spend a lot of time d=\\nuring the hearing delving into details about the partnerships. But he said =\\nit was ''pretty hard to limit inquiries in circumstances like this.''=20\\n''I expect there will be attention to virtually all of the areas: 401(k) pl=\\nans, insider trading, partnership construction, a whole series of things.''=\\n=20\\nEnron, he added, has said that some partnership information does not techni=\\ncally belong to the company and that as a result it does not have all that =\\ninformation. But, Mr. Dorgan said, ''in many cases, they own 97 percent of =\\nthe partnerships,'' so they should be able to get it.=20\\nWilliam C. Powers Jr., the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, w=\\nho is chairman of the Enron special committee preparing the report, decline=\\nd to discuss the timing of the report's release or to give details. He woul=\\nd not even disclose whether he would be testifying before Congress next wee=\\nk, even though he is scheduled to do so.=20\\nMr. Powers said the work of the committee he heads ''is not precluding any =\\nother investigation from going forward with investigation, charges, punishm=\\nent, whatever.'' The report, he said, will stand on its own, and ''governme=\\nnt agencies can build on that if they find it useful.''=20\\nPeople at the law school said Mr. Powers was outraged at a suggestion publi=\\nshed today in The Washington Post that he would be taking part in a concert=\\ned defense of Enron in his testimony before Congress. Mr. Powers has conten=\\nded from the beginning of his investigation that his role is to produce an =\\nimpartial report.=20\\nMr. Powers has come under fire from advocacy groups and from the local news=\\npaper, The Austin American-Statesman, over accusations that his impartialit=\\ny is compromised by the close ties between the University of Texas, and Enr=\\non and the law firms that have represented the company, especially Vinson &=\\n Elkins.=20\\nThe critics have said that the appearance of a conflict of interest is so g=\\nreat that Mr. Powers should not have taken on the assignment.=20\\n''Dean Powers is a nice guy and a great professor, but unfortunately, looki=\\nng at the facts, he has multiple apparent conflicts that, rightly or wrongl=\\ny, cast a shadow on this report,'' said Cristen Feldman, a lawyer for Texan=\\ns for Public Justice, a group that tracks campaign contributions in the sta=\\nte.=20\\nIn other Enron-related developments today, Representative George Miller, De=\\nmocrat of California, asked that no witness in the House's various Enron he=\\narings be given immunity without approval from Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a=\\n Republican.=20\\nSeparately, the General Accounting Office, which is preparing to sue the Wh=\\nite House to obtain records of meetings of executives at Enron and other en=\\nergy companies with administration officials working on Vice President Dick=\\n Cheney's energy task force last spring, said it had hired the law firm of =\\nSidley, Austin, Brown & Wood.=20\\nIn addition, Senators Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is the chairman of=\\n the Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee's se=\\nnior Republican, sent letters to the United States Export-Import Bank, the =\\nOverseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Agenc=\\ny requesting information on what help the federal agencies had given Enron.=\\n The committee is preparing for hearings into the company later.=20\\nThe chairman of an accounting ethics board, meanwhile, reaffirmed the board=\\n's decision to disband in light of the sketchy proposals by the Securities =\\nand Exchange Commission to restructure disciplinary rules.

Th=\\ne partnerships enlisted outside investors to buy Enron assets as a means of=\\n helping the company artificially keep its debt level low and earnings high=\\n.=20\\nMistakes in the reporting of some transactions with two partnerships, LJM-C=\\nayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, forced the company to restate 4 1/2 years of =\\nearnings, including a reduction in reported profit by $586 million and add =\\n$2.5 billion in debt to its books.=20\\nIn November, the internal committee determined that Fastow and other employ=\\nees had profited from investments in the partnerships. Those employees were=\\n fired.=20\\nThe report will be the first official word from the committee since then. A=\\nt the insistence of creditors, it will be posted on Web sites of Enron and =\\nthe U.S. bankruptcy court in New York.=20\\nEnron officials declined comment on the report, as did representatives for =\\nFastow and Skilling.=20\\nAn Andersen spokesman said Enron officials simply made some bad business de=\\ncisions and are trying to blame the auditors.=20\\n\"The notion that the leaders on the board were not aware of these issues is=\\n absolutely implausible,\" said Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton. \"These we=\\nre sophisticated people with sophisticated business advisers.\"=20\\nPatrick McGurn with Institutional Shareholders Services, a company that adv=\\nises shareholders on corporate governance issues, said Enron's board may ha=\\nve a valid argument if it can show it didn't know enough details to assess =\\nthe risk involved.=20\\n\"There's a question as to who had the ability to see the big picture, if th=\\ne board was so compartmentalized that they could only know one part of it a=\\nt a time,\" McGurn said.=20\\nIt's not unusual for boards to see only summaries of very complicated deals=\\n and issues, McGurn said.=20\\n\"But even if all of this is true, it still means either the board wasn't di=\\nligent enough, it willingly went along with something that was wrong, or th=\\ney were just stupid,\" he said.=20\\nIt's not clear if the report will also criticize Enron's longtime law firm,=\\n Vinson & Elkins. The firm did not help set up the LJM partnerships, but wa=\\ns asked to look into concerns raised by Enron executive Sherron Watkins in =\\na now well-known October 2001 memo to Lay and the board.=20\\nIn an Oct. 15 letter to Enron general counsel James Derrick, V&E's Max Hend=\\nrick addressed some of those concerns, including the potential for conflict=\\ns of interest in Fastow's dual roles as Enron CFO and chief partner in the =\\nLJM partnerships, and the board's waiver of its code of ethics in meetings =\\non June 28, 1999, and Oct. 11, 1999, to allow him to run the partnerships.=\\n=20\\nThe letter concluded that -- based on its interviews -- no outside counsel =\\nor auditors were needed to investigate the issues further. Hendrick did say=\\n, however, that \"bad cosmetics\" on the LJM partnerships and its investments=\\n in certain Enron technology and communications assets, coupled with the po=\\nor financial performance of those assets, could lead to a \"serious risk of =\\nadverse publicity and litigation.\"=20\\nThe day after the letter was written, Enron began to unwind those investmen=\\nts with LJM.=20\\nThe fact that the code of ethics was waived to allow Fastow to run LJM is f=\\nurther indication that the board should have been more vigilant, said McGur=\\nn.=20\\nMcGurn and other observers are already questioning the impartiality of the =\\ninvestigation, given that many board members who approved parts of LJM are =\\ninvolved. But the presence of William McLucas, the former director of the S=\\necurities and Exchange Commission's division of enforcement, on the committ=\\nee as general counsel will lend it more credibility, said one source.=20\\n\"Lucas is a notorious hard-ass,\" said the source, who asked not to be ident=\\nified. \"So I can't imagine he'll go too soft on anyone.\"=20\\n\\nFew of Lay Family's Real-Estate Assets Are on the Market, Listing Records S=\\nhow\\nBy Gary McWilliams\\nStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n02/01/2002\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nA8\\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nEarlier this week, Linda P.

They own 18 proper=\\nties in Houston, Galveston, Texas, and Aspen, Colo., according to real-esta=\\nte records. But only two of the properties, vacation homes in the resort to=\\nwn of Aspen, are being offered for sale.=20\\nOn NBC's \"Today,\" Mrs. Lay described the couple's plight in the wake of the=\\n Enron bankruptcy as a fight for liquidity because most of their wealth was=\\n tied up in Enron stock, now nearly worthless. \"Other than the home we live=\\n in, everything we own is for sale,\" she said.=20\\nThe comments stirred a torrent of criticism in Houston, where about 4,000 E=\\nnron employees have seen their jobs and stock holdings evaporate. Belo Corp=\\n.'s Houston television station, KHOU, reported that the couple's Houston an=\\nd Galveston properties didn't show any sign of being for sale.=20\\nThe family's Houston-based investment office didn't return a call requestin=\\ng clarification.

Two other homes, valued at more than $6.1 million each, were =\\nlisted with an Aspen real-estate firm on Nov. 12, two weeks before Enron fi=\\nled for bankruptcy. Mr. Lay also sold a third of his stock in Compaq Comput=\\ner Corp. at the end of October, two months before resigning from its board.=\\n=20\\nHowever, Mr. Lay has retained significant stock holdings in Compaq, Eli Lil=\\nly & Co. and other companies where he once served as a director. Those shar=\\nes are currently valued at more than $10 million.=20\\nStill, along with Enron, the Lays have seen some investments sour. Through =\\nprivate partnerships, they are the largest individual investors in a strugg=\\nling Houston online company that has cut its work force four times in the p=\\nast year.=20\\nThe Lays invested between $18 million and $20 million out of the more than =\\n$150 million that Questia raised since its inception in 1998, according to =\\npeople close to the firm.=20\\nQuestia sells access to online books to college students for $20 a month.

Mr. Powers is scheduled to testify at a congressi=\\nonal hearing into the Enron collapse Tuesday.=20\\nMr. Powers, chairman of the special committee, had ties to Enron executives=\\n and its law firm, Vinson & Elkins, and helped raise millions of dollars fr=\\nom them for the University of Texas, the defense lawyers and other said. Mr=\\n. Powers serves on the university Capital Campaign Committee, and Enron has=\\n given $3 million to the university, and more than $250,000 to the law scho=\\nol, since Mr. Powers became dean in 1998. In addition, Vinson & Elkins endo=\\nwed a chair at the law school.=20\\nCritics of the expected report also point out that other Enron directors on=\\n the special committee approved the transactions that they are now reviewin=\\ng. The Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 2 that the board explicitly approv=\\ned the structure of the partnerships now under scrutiny.=20\\nThe company announced the formation of the special committee in the fall, j=\\nust as the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation in=\\nto partnerships used by Enron to move debt off its books.=20\\nThe special committee's other two members are Raymond Troubh, a New York fi=\\nnancial consultant named to Enron's board in late November; and Herbert S. =\\nWinokur, a director since 1985 and chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings I=\\nnc., a private investment company. Mr. Winokur also was chairman of the boa=\\nrd's finance committee, which recommended that the board suspend the compan=\\ny's ethics code so former company treasurer, Andrew Fastow, could run a par=\\ntnership.=20\\nThe committee retained William McLucas, a former SEC enforcement chief who =\\nleft after 22 years to join the Washington, D.C., law firm of Wilmer, Cutle=\\nr & Pickering, to advise the committee. Mr. McLucas, 51, was known as a no-=\\nnonsense securities cop in the eight years he served as the SEC's top law-e=\\nnforcement officer.=20\\nEnron has said its dealings with the Fastow partnerships were legal and pro=\\nperly disclosed to investors.

SCOTT RECKARD\\nTIMES STAFF WRITER\\n\\n02/01/2002\\nLos Angeles Times\\nHome Edition\\nC-1\\nCopyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company\\n\\nIn the rubble of recent financial collapses, one prestigious institution se=\\nems especially vulnerable: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the nation's second-lar=\\ngest bank.=20\\nThe New York company, a lead lender to Enron Corp., Kmart Corp. and telecom=\\nmunications firm Global Crossing Ltd., is at risk of losing billions in dea=\\nlings with bankrupt firms, as well as losing heavily in Argentina's economi=\\nc meltdown.\\nJ.P. Morgan also lost $1.1 billion last year on its stakes in businesses, i=\\nncluding many ailing technology companies, and is accused by insurers of he=\\nlping Enron conceal vast losses. Morgan strongly disputes the charge, but t=\\nhe allegation, coupled with the hefty losses, raises questions about the ju=\\ndgment of an institution that traces its roots back more than 200 years.=20\\nThe bank's woes, accompanied by sizable losses on loans at many other finan=\\ncial giants, also reveal chinks in a banking industry generally regarded as=\\n a pillar for the nation's recovery from an economic slowdown and from Sept=\\n. 11.=20\\nJ.P. Morgan fares badly in comparison with big competitors such as Citigrou=\\np Inc., the largest U.S. banking concern, and Bank of America Inc., the thi=\\nrd-largest. Despite their huge losses in Argentina, Enron and other corpora=\\nte collapses, Citigroup earned $4 billion and BofA posted a profit of $2 bi=\\nllion in the fourth quarter, bolstered in part by robust consumer lending.=\\n=20\\nMorgan, by contrast, lost $332million in the fourth quarter, compared with =\\na $708-million profit a year earlier. For the year, the company still earne=\\nd $1.6 billion.=20\\nWall Street's skittishness over projected losses at J.P. Morgan has been ap=\\nparent in the steady stock sell-off in recent weeks after a \"continuing par=\\nade of train wrecks,\" in the words of analyst E. Reilly Tierney at Fox-Pitt=\\n Kelton in New York.=20\\nThe stock, which traded above $40 early in December, hovered near $32 this =\\nweek before closing Thursday at $34.05, up 99 cents a share, on the New Yor=\\nk Stock Exchange.=20\\nSome analysts remain bullish on Morgan, saying the institution is fundament=\\nally sound and the financial setbacks are only temporary. And by some indus=\\ntry measures, J.P. Morgan's financials look sturdy. A key ratio of nonperfo=\\nrming assets to total assets, for example, was just 0.87% as of Dec. 31, we=\\nll below the 2% figure regarded as a sign of potential trouble.=20\\nInvestors' concerns surfaced in December after Enron's bankruptcy, when J.P=\\n. Morgan, which had a reputation for usually disclosing bad news promptly a=\\nnd completely, suddenly tripled its estimate of its potential Enron losses,=\\n to $2.6 billion.=20\\nNearly $1 billion of the total stemmed from insurers' refusals to pay Enron=\\n-related claims on unfulfilled energy contracts. The insurers contended in =\\na lawsuit filed in federal court in New York that the losses resulted from =\\nJ.P. Morgan's setting up \"sham\" offshore energy trading concerns to do busi=\\nness with Enron.=20\\nJ.P. Morgan contends its energy trading companies were above board, adding =\\nthat--unlike Enron--it included the results on its balance sheets.=20\\nThe bank also says the hefty loan losses from the mammoth bankruptcies are =\\na result of J.P. Morgan's position as the leading arranger of the biggest c=\\nredit lines to the biggest businesses. These so-called syndicated loans are=\\n carved up and shared by dozens of banks.=20\\n\"We're handling 40% of the syndicated loans, and when companies go down we =\\ntend to be exposed,\" said J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau.=20\\nBut other banks in the syndicates typically take on responsibility for more=\\n than 90% of the amounts lent. Though J.P. Morgan arranged $1.6 billion in =\\ncredit lines for Kmart, for example, it had just $117 million in unsecured =\\nloans when the retailer filed for bankruptcy last month. Likewise, though J=\\n.P. Morgan had helped arrange $2.25 billion in loans for Global Crossing, i=\\nt's now owed less than $100 million by the telecom firm, according to peopl=\\ne close to the situation. And while J.P. Morgan still has a $500-million ex=\\nposure to Argentina, Citigroup and FleetBoston have far more.=20\\nIndeed, only about 10% of J.P. Morgan's earnings come from lending these da=\\nys, compared with 50% a decade ago, Lemkau said, meaning its comparative cr=\\nedit risk exposure actually has declined dramatically.=20\\nStill, there's no denying the bank's missteps, which include an 8% stake in=\\n an Argentine bank accused of fraud, and loans to a European cable TV compa=\\nny that has threatened to default on $17.5 billion in debt.=20\\nProspects looked far brighter at the end of 2000, when J.P. Morgan Chase & =\\nCo. emerged in its current manifestation via the colossal merger of Chase M=\\nanhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co.=20\\nAfter deregulation tore down walls separating banks, brokerages and insurer=\\ns, the idea was to compete better with Citigroup--itself formed in the merg=\\ner of Citicorp and Travelers Group--by selling more services to clients. Th=\\ne newly formed giant hoped especially to persuade companies with bank loans=\\n to use J.P. Morgan's investment banking services, which typically are more=\\n profitable than commercial lending.=20\\nBut the technology meltdown, the recession and Sept. 11 combined to create =\\nthe worst environment in years for stock offerings, mergers and other stapl=\\nes of investment banking.=20\\nThe big question now, Tierney said, is whether J.P. Morgan failed to assess=\\n credit risks properly at companies because it figured making loans was a s=\\nure path to bigger profit on other services.=20\\nHowever, Lemkau said the dollar amount of corporate loans on J.P. Morgan's =\\nbooks has declined for the last three years. \"It's a misconception we're le=\\nnding like a drunken sailor so we can get our hand on more profitable busin=\\nesses,\" she said. \"It's just not true.\"=20\\nNo doubt reflecting the uncertainties facing all financial institutions aft=\\ner Sept. 11 and the Enron meltdown, the range of expert opinions about Morg=\\nan is astonishingly wide.=20\\nSome analysts, such as Michael Mayo at Prudential Financial, have slapped \"=\\nsell\" ratings on the bank while others, such as Diana P. Yates at A.G. Edwa=\\nrds & Sons Inc., rate it a \"strong buy.\"=20\\nYates characterized concerns over the insurers' allegations of collusion wi=\\nth Enron as \"overdone.\" She also warned against judging J.P. Morgan by its =\\nadmittedly atrocious last quarter.=20\\n\"They're taking some hits, but they're a big company with a $41-billion equ=\\nity base. It's not like they're going out of business,\" she said.\\n\\nGRAPHIC: Wall St.'s Verdict; ; CREDIT: Los Angeles Times=20\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

At the same time, the Wall Street giant pitched =\\nEnron bonds to clients as a solid investment.=20\\nNow, at least one institutional investor who bought the bonds is hopping ma=\\nd -- and has taken the beef to court.\\nIn a suit filed recently in federal court in New York, Silvercreek Manageme=\\nnt Inc., a Toronto investment company that bought Enron bonds in October, a=\\nccuses Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, as well as Goldman Sachs Grou=\\np Inc. and Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America Securities LLC, of promo=\\nting Enron securities even when they knew the company was on the brink of c=\\nollapse.=20\\n\"The brokers were calling our clients telling them that this was a wonderfu=\\nl opportunity to buy these instruments,\" says Joe Cotchett, a lawyer repres=\\nenting Silvercreek. \"They were giving our client a sell job.\"=20\\nCitigroup, Goldman and Banc of America declined to comment.=20\\nThe suit is one of the first to put the blame for Enron squarely on Wall St=\\nreet's role in facilitating Enron's deception. \"Enron's investment bankers =\\nsold the securities which propped up the pyramid,\" the suit alleges. \"In th=\\ne process, these firms earned $214 million in underwriting fees alone, and =\\nmuch more for lending, derivatives trading and merger advice.\"=20\\nBut the case highlights a broader question. Did Enron's lenders have a duty=\\n to their investing clients to disclose the depths of Enron's woes? Some an=\\nalysts say that investors should probably have known that they were buying =\\nsecurities from financial institutions who were in a position to know that =\\nEnron was facing dire straits. Yet Citigroup wouldn't have to disclose its =\\nknowledge of Enron's troubles because of lender confidentiality.=20\\n\"When you're a bank lender, you can hide behind the confidentiality rule,\" =\\nsays David Hendler, an analyst at market research firm CreditSights.=20\\nIn its suit, Silvercreek says the three financial firms were pitching Enron=\\n securities to Silvercreek as late as October, including some new bonds tha=\\nt would convert into Enron stock. The Canadian firm, which invested $175 mi=\\nllion in Enron bonds in October, says it lost $120 million and is seeking c=\\nompensation and unspecified damages.=20\\nSure, Enron had been through a rough patch over the summer, the Wall Street=\\n sales pitch went, according to Silvercreek's lawyers. But Enron wasn't all=\\n that bad off, and the bonds were selling at a sharp discount. That purport=\\ned pitch was mirrored by some of the research reports the brokerage firms h=\\nad released during October.=20\\n\"We reiterate our Buy rating on Enron,\" an Oct. 19 Salomon Smith Barney rep=\\nort on Enron said, \"after untangling part of a complicated story involving =\\ntheir balance sheet.\"=20\\nEnron's story, of course, wasn't nearly so upbeat. Its balance-sheet high j=\\ninks caused a sudden loss of confidence, bringing about a liquidity shortag=\\ne so dire that Enron was forced to draw down an emergency $3 billion credit=\\n line on Oct. 25, only a few days after Salomon's report. That move signale=\\nd Enron was running short of crucial operating capital.=20\\nCitigroup's lending division knew as well as anybody that Enron was facing =\\ntrouble, since it had been one of the top banks arranging the credit line. =\\nYet the brokerage companies had Enron securities in their firm's inventory =\\nto unload, according to the Silvercreek suit.=20\\nEnron had sold Wall Street firms about $1.9 billion in convertible bonds th=\\nat firms such as Citigroup were free to sell to investors by June of 2001, =\\nthe court papers say. But the sales of these securities weren't going so we=\\nll, Silvercreek alleges.=20\\nSo Citigroup's brokers became increasingly aggressive in pushing the Enron =\\nbonds on institutional investors, Silvercreek's lawyers say. Citigroup sold=\\n Silvercreek its last chunk of Enron securities on Oct. 25 -- the same day =\\nthat Enron drew down its credit line from Citigroup.=20\\nExecutives familiar with Citigroup thinking assert that Silvercreek should =\\nhave known the risks of investing in Enron as well as any other investor. M=\\neanwhile, the lending side knew about the problems at Enron, but the broker=\\nage side didn't. That is in keeping with the so-called Chinese Wall on Wall=\\n Street, which seeks to separate businesses to reduce conflicts.=20\\nFurther complicating the role of Citigroup in the dispute is that on Oct. 2=\\n5 -- the same day Enron drew down its credit line -- Citigroup met with oth=\\ner bankers to begin discussions on a new, $1 billion Enron credit line.=20\\nThe new financing, which was announced much later, was firmly secured by co=\\nllateral in the form of Enron pipeline assets. Yet Citigroup effectively ro=\\nlled some of its existing unsecured Enron financing into the new secured cr=\\nedit line -- thereby shielding itself from Enron losses shortly after pushi=\\nng Enron debt on to other investors.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Employers enjoy tax benefits for iss=\\nuing company stock to retirement accounts, and the practice is also cheaper=\\n than making cash retirement contributions. But, in the case of a bankruptc=\\ny such as Enron's, the restrictions can wipe out employee nest eggs, advoca=\\ntes of change argue.=20\\nThe president's package wouldn't limit the amount of employer-company stock=\\n that could be held in 401(k) plans. Such caps have been proposed in legisl=\\nation, including a bill introduced by Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of Cal=\\nifornia and Jon Corzine of New Jersey that is supported by consumer and lab=\\nor groups.=20\\nCalling for increased access to investment advice, Mr. Bush embraced a bill=\\n sponsored by Rep. John Boehner (R., Ohio) and passed by the House last yea=\\nr. The White House now will push for action in the Senate.=20\\nThe Boehner bill would encourage employers to provide more investment advic=\\ne to their workers by shielding them from lawsuits and fiduciary responsibi=\\nlity for investment decisions made based on advice given by other parties. =\\nBut the bill also would allow pension-plan managers to provide such advice,=\\n a move which consumer groups say would result in a dangerous conflict of i=\\nnterest.=20\\nThe National Association of Manufacturers, which is leading a coalition to =\\noppose major pension changes, and other industry groups have voiced support=\\n for Mr. Boehner's bill.=20\\nMr. Bush's proposals also would raise the stakes for employers when they im=\\npose \"blackout periods\" on stock trading for pension plans. Companies routi=\\nnely impose such periods when they are changing plan administrators, for in=\\nstance.=20\\nIn addition to requiring senior executives to face the same blackout period=\\ns as lower-level workers, Mr. Bush is calling for a 30-day notice before a =\\nblackout begins. He also will recommend that employers be held responsible =\\nfor what happens to workers' investments during the periods when their stoc=\\nk is frozen. Under current regulations, employers are protected from that l=\\niability.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

So I'm delighted to report the trickle of notes and letters fro=\\nm Old Enronians has become a torrent. My inbox runneth over.\\n     This week's pile of cards and letters offers several different kinds o=\\nf information. The first is the sort of colorful detail that will be useful=\\n to whoever eventually makes the crummy TV movie about the energy trader's =\\ncollapse.\\n     It's fun to know, for instance, that Enron's chief risk officer had a =\\npicture of the Titanic on the wall of his office, and that Enron's chief ac=\\ncountant drove a Ferrari. It's even more fun to know there was plenty of se=\\nxual scandal in the halls at Enron, to go along with the financial one. Off=\\nice affairs are common at any big company, but Enron's steamy Texas culture=\\n seems to have created a particularly juicy hothouse.\\n\\nBook Fodder\\n\\n     The next category of information is the deeper understanding that will=\\n be useful to whoever writes the respectable best-selling book about Enron.\\n     For the first time since the scandal broke, for example, I've read a s=\\natisfying explanation for Enron's many disastrous investments in foreign as=\\nsets.\\n     As this correspondent put it, the main motive for paying ridiculously =\\nbig sums for Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on was not =\\nforeign market information, or access to foreign politicians, but the need =\\nto be able to cover a short position.\\n     In its attempt to create the same sort of trading markets in developin=\\ng countries as it had in the U.S., Enron exposed itself to a new kind of ma=\\nrket risk.\\n     It was one thing to be caught short in U.S. natural gas, in which you =\\ncould hedge your position on a well-established futures exchange. It was an=\\nother to be caught short Indian electricity. Owning the underlying physical=\\n assets ensured that would never happen. (But also ensured Enron would be c=\\nonstitutionally long all new markets.)\\n\\nFriends and FOEs\\n\\n     The final category of information is the sort of corporate intrigue th=\\nat will be gold to the investigative reporters newly assigned to the Enron =\\nbeat.\\n     For example, there was, according to one former Enron employee, a grou=\\np of individual investors known as the Friends of Enron.\\n     These people, ironically known as FOEs, were offered the following dea=\\nl: Agree to put your name on a million dollar investment in a private offsh=\\nore partnership stuffed to the gills with junky assets, and Enron would len=\\nd 95 percent of the money and guarantee you at least a 15 percent annual re=\\nturn. In other words, put up fifty grand and Enron would ensure you receive=\\nd 150 grand at the end of the year.\\n     So, who was offered this deal? My Enron correspondent contends the lis=\\nt of people on it will read \"like a Who's Who.''\\n     Bloomberg News this week revealed that some individuals who put money =\\ninto Enron partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow=\\n were executives at Merrill Lynch & Co.\\n     This is interesting -- and not merely because of the blatant conflict =\\nof interest in employees of a firm taking huge sums of money from Enron whe=\\nn it is the role of their firm, in part, to serve as a detached observer of=\\n Enron. The conceit that Wall Street firms evaluate U.S. companies honestly=\\n was dropped long ago. (Merrill is a passive minority investor in Bloomberg=\\n LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, and has said the investments didn't repr=\\nesent a conflict of interest.)\\n\\nLooking the Other Way\\n\\n     No, what's astonishing is that the people who were offered these deals=\\n by Enron didn't acknowledge what they said about a company that last year =\\nranked as the seventh largest in the U.S. by sales. A lot of well placed pe=\\nople knew such a giant company was rotten and yet no one said anything abou=\\nt it, or altered his behavior in any way towards the company.\\n    Or almost no one. A couple of local Houston institutional investors who=\\n declined similar sweet deals could see clearly enough what it meant.\\n     Danny Bowers, the chief investment officer of the Houston Fireman's Re=\\nlief and Retirement Fund, has said \"there was a pretty blatant conflict of =\\ninterest. It was kind of a stinky deal.''\\n     David Long, who runs the Houston Municipal Employees Pension Fund, tol=\\nd Bloomberg News that, \"We had a lot of discussion about potential conflict=\\ns of interest. You had the CFO of Enron, who's an employee of Enron, acting=\\n as general partner of a partnership which for the most part could be const=\\nrued to be adversarial to Enron.''\\n\\nNeed Not to Know\\n\\n     So why didn't any respectable person respond the same way to Enron's o=\\nffer of free money?\\n     One of the curious aspects of the Enron scandal is the way the world c=\\nonfigured itself so that it didn't need to know the truth about the company=\\n. There was a need, both financial and psychological, not to know.\\n     Now we know the partnership structure was an open secret on Wall Stree=\\nt. There was a lot of money to be made on the short side by a Wall Street p=\\nerson if he leaked Enron's moral infrastructure to, say, the Wall Street Jo=\\nurnal. But, at least as far as we know, no one at Merrill did this.\\n     So, who else was offered a sweet deal by Enron and yet failed to be sh=\\nocked or alarmed? Anyone currently residing in Washington? I await your car=\\nds and letters.\\n\\n-- Michael Lewis in Berkeley, California, at mlewis1@bloomberg.net through =\\nthe New York newsroom (212) 318-2320/ Editor: Rooney\\n\\n\\n\\nHouston, we have a problem\\nThe city where deregulation is king is in Enron denial - and won't let go o=\\nf its wildcatting ways.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\\nBy Katharine Mieszkowski, Salon.com\\nFeb. 1, 2002 | HOUSTON -- In a skyscraper just across the street from Enron=\\n's sparkly new downtown headquarters, Pamela Lovett explains why the bigges=\\nt bankruptcy in history isn't something to get all worked up about. \"This i=\\ns not the first company to declare bankruptcy,\" she says. \"Personally, I ha=\\nve very high regard for Ken Lay.\"=20\\nLovett is the head of economic development for the Greater Houston Partners=\\nhip, a local business group with 135 CEO members, which Lay was the chairma=\\nn of in 1994. Her job is wooing big companies to come set up shop in the la=\\nissez-faire, pro-business Promised Land of Houston.=20\\nShe lowers her voice to remind me reverently that in this country we assume=\\n the accused are \"innocent until proven otherwise,\" and when it comes to En=\\nron \"a lot of things are being tried by speculation.\" But the civics lesson=\\n is interrupted when Lovett's colleague David McCollum comes bursting in to=\\n announce that the FBI has just occupied Enron's headquarters, based on rep=\\norts that employees were still shredding documents there a few days earlier=\\n.=20\\n\"We're just having so much fun now!\" McCollum jokes before popping back out=\\n, leaving Lovett to continue to argue that in spite of the Enron collapse t=\\nhings here in Houston are just fine, thanks.=20\\nCongress is holding hearings, criminal investigations are under way and cla=\\nss action suits are bubbling over, but in Houston, civic leaders don't want=\\n to jump to any untoward conclusions. Despite all the sob stories generated=\\n by thousands of local laid-off Enron workers and retirees, Mayor Lee Brown=\\n has been careful not to cast blame. When Ken Lay resigned as the CEO of En=\\nron, the mayor said in a statement: \"Only those who are working all day, ev=\\nery day on this situation are in a position to know all the details.\" Oh, a=\\nnd by the way, Lay sponsored a $50,000 fundraiser for Brown's election last=\\n year.=20\\nThe Houston City Council isn't exactly warming up the tar-and-feathers eith=\\ner. Instead, it's busy awarding a $198,000 consulting contract to Arthur An=\\ndersen, a company now feverishly attempting to escape its own immolation af=\\nter its failure to competently audit Enron's books. \"That disgusted me,\" sa=\\nys Amy Oberg, a former Enron employee who lost retirement savings in her 40=\\n1K as well as her job. \"The fact that the city went and did that in the mid=\\ndle of the federal investigation just blows my mind. For the people here wh=\\no were hurt by Enron, that was a slap in the face.\"=20\\nGreetings from Houston, the city that tries too hard. Houston is a city tha=\\nt is proudly unapologetic about its status as an icon of anything-goes dere=\\ngulation. Nowhere will you find a place more consciously devoted to living =\\nthe free-market version of the American dream. But there's an insecurity lu=\\nrking beneath the pride, an inferiority complex bred in part by the spectac=\\nular flameouts and huge busts that are a natural consequence of living with=\\n as few rules as possible. It is, as one resident notes, a place where \"peo=\\nple come to make money, and then they go someplace else. Nobody retires in =\\nHouston.\"=20\\nEnron's fall from grace is but the most recent disaster to bring out the co=\\nntradictions inherent in the Houston way. Even as many Houstonians feel a l=\\ningering sense of betrayal and disappointment and no shortage of embarrassm=\\nent, they are still unwilling to ask themselves: Why did Enron happen here =\\nin Houston? And can anything be done to prevent the next catastrophe?=20\\nProbably not. Because to do anything substantive would be a betrayal of Hou=\\nston's founding myth -- the idea that the city is a place where a guy can c=\\nome to make a lot of money without being held back by a bunch of party-poop=\\ning naysayers and regulators. It's a myth that fits neatly into the explici=\\nt deregulation platform so heavily promoted by Ken Lay and Enron, and it's =\\nnot something that Houstonians will give up on easily.=20\\n\"There will be no reform in Houston,\" predicts Dr. Alvin Tarlov, a physicia=\\nn and policy advisor at the Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston.=\\n=20\\nThere never is.=20\\n\"This is a city where you can make your fortune and not have people looking=\\n over your shoulder saying: 'You can't do that,'\" says Houston native Carlo=\\ns Hernandez, with evident pride, adding quickly: \"Enron was taking that to =\\nthe extreme. That's just criminal.\"=20\\nBut from the beginning, Houston's wide-open ethos has been an invitation to=\\n criminals. \"Houston is a city that started as a land scam. It's still a wi=\\nldcatters town,\" says Jim Hightower, the Texas writer and wisecracker. Back=\\n in the 1820s the city's roguish developers sold scrip for 5 or 10 cents an=\\n acre that didn't actually convey property rights to any land. It was a sca=\\nm that makes pushing stock that's not based on real revenues look pretty ta=\\nme.=20\\nTo this day, locals eschew government oversight so much that many suburbani=\\ntes here don't even live under any city government. They inhabit unincorpor=\\nated districts run by the residents, in a barely governed super-sprawl of c=\\nheap housing. Here's how it works: A developer buys a piece of the endless =\\nraw prairie land outside city limits. He puts a trailer on it and has his c=\\nonstruction foreman move in. Then, an only-in-Texas \"election\" is held. The=\\n sole voter -- the construction foreman -- votes in favor of developing the=\\n property, and voila! -- a new district is created complete with tax-exempt=\\n bond status.=20\\nWhen the new 'burb is built and inhabited, the developer turns it over to t=\\nhe citizens, who repay the debt from the bonds with property taxes. There a=\\nre some 400 of these unincorporated districts in the Greater Houston area, =\\nand you only really hear about them when the City of Houston cherry-picks a=\\n wealthy one, annexing it to assume its lucrative tax base -- usually again=\\nst vehement \"Don't tread on me!\" protests from the residents.=20\\nIn the unincorporated areas and the city proper that together make up the s=\\nprawling greater Houston area, population 4.5 million, lies a case study in=\\n what is wrought by living according to the commandment \"There shall be no =\\nzoning.\" Sublime, helter-skelter juxtapositions are everywhere. Right next =\\nto an eight-lane freeway, a Discount tire store huddles near a traveling ca=\\nrnival; children spin themselves silly on blinking rides that rival NASA's =\\nanti-gravity chambers, under the vacant gaze of an overly made-up model loo=\\nming down from a billboard advertising an all-night porn store. And don't m=\\niss the 20-story office building right across the street from a neighborhoo=\\nd of brand-new monster houses, with no niceties like landscaping buffering =\\nthe commercial district from the residential one. Neighborhood deed restric=\\ntions impose some conformity, but those rules end at the property lines -- =\\nthen, hallelujah! Anything goes! There were a few years there in the early =\\n'90s when the Houston City Council did impose zoning, albeit after the fact=\\n, but by 1994 the citizens had voted to repeal this brazen act of governmen=\\nt intervention.=20\\n\"Strip malls and strip clubs. There's a Gap on every corner next to a Starb=\\nucks,\" says Tracy Delmer, a speech pathologist who has lived here all her l=\\nife. \"It's all about trying to make your strip mall prettier than the other=\\n strip mall down the street.\"=20\\nThe flip side to freedom from nasty government oversight is some of the wor=\\nst air pollution in the country. Some 2.5 percent of the world's total refi=\\nning capacity lies in the greater Houston area, and Houston's high ozone re=\\nadings are rivaled only by Los Angeles. The state, in true Texas laissez-fa=\\nire style, has been notoriously lax on environmental regulation, allowing o=\\nld petrochemical plants to be grandfathered in when introducing new, watere=\\nd down environmental rules, which just means that those old, polluting plan=\\nts never seem to die off.=20\\n\"That's Texas. If the federal government forces Texas to do it, they do it,=\\n\" says Jim Blackburn, a Houston environmental lawyer. \"But otherwise, it's =\\nall up for grabs.\"=20\\nIs it any wonder that few people seem to come here just for fun? \"People do=\\nn't say 'I went to Houston last summer,'\" says Delmer, \"like they say 'I we=\\nnt to Seattle.'\"=20\\n\"All over the country, if people hear they're being transferred to Houston =\\nthey want to commit suicide,\" says Amy Jaffe, a local energy policy advisor=\\n, who still finds the distaste outsiders have for Houston puzzling. It's no=\\nt as if Houston is some kind of cultural wasteland, she notes, enumerating =\\na laundry list of Houston's sophisticated worldly charms, from the opera to=\\n the ballet to the symphony.=20\\nAll of which, it should be noted, are funded almost entirely by private sou=\\nrces.=20\\nNationally, Enron's demise is stirring debate on a huge range of issues, fr=\\nom campaign finance reform to accounting rules to the very ascendancy of th=\\ne idea of deregulation.=20\\nBut not here in Houston.=20\\n\"None of us blame President Bush or free-market capitalism for Enron's coll=\\napse,\" says Raymund Eich, a local patent agent, who believes that liberals =\\nare using the Enron bankruptcy as an excuse to smear both. Only Dallas and =\\nWashington gave more money to Bush's 2000 campaign than Houston, and Enron =\\nis well known to be Bush's single biggest corporate backer, but Eich doesn'=\\nt think the government owes anything to hard-hit Enron employees or investo=\\nrs, noting that \"Houstonians are more self-reliant than people in other pla=\\nces.\"=20\\nTake Houston accountants -- a phrase that in February 2002 sounds like the =\\npunchline to a very bad joke waiting to happen. Here's a group who would li=\\nke very much to remain self-reliant, even as they fear that their days of s=\\nelf-regulation may be numbered, thanks to Andersen's bad behavior. Over lun=\\nch -- beef stew on noodles -- the members of the Houston Chapter of the Tex=\\nas Society of Certified Public Accountants at their annual business meeting=\\n at the J.K. Marriott dish about Andersen's role in the Enron debacle.=20\\n\"I think someone should pay,\" says Ann-Marie Curtin, a CPA at Prime Asset M=\\nanagement, a Houston property company. \"There's no way that there wasn't a =\\nsignificant amount of illegal activity going on.\"=20\\nBut new rules to help prevent such nefarious activities? They won't hear of=\\n it. Patrick L. Durio, president-elect of the local group and the chairman =\\nof the -- voluntary! -- ethics committee of the Texas Society of CPAs, says=\\n: \"Government regulation is not the answer. I don't want to see the governm=\\nent setting accounting standards,\" noting that the industry has been self-r=\\negulating for 100 years. \"And I don't think that politicians should be gett=\\ning involved in it.\"=20\\nIn Houston, they probably won't. Because no matter how big Enron's corporat=\\ne implosion appears on the national scale, such colossal busts are hardly u=\\nnusual in Houston history. In fact, Enron is a mere blip compared to the ci=\\nty-wide bust that occurred in the mid-'80s. Houston is always trying to sha=\\nke the perception that it's just an urban pit stop for roughnecks who rip n=\\natural resources out of the ground on the way to getting really, really ric=\\nh. Because many Houstonians remember what happened when those roughnecks an=\\nd their moneymen ran the town right into the ground.=20\\n\"Imagine a city where everybody had gone to Las Vegas for the weekend and l=\\nost everything they owned,\" says Jaffe.=20\\nIn the mid-'80s, the city lost a quarter of a million jobs in the oil and r=\\neal estate bust. \"There were a lot of people who went from owning lots of r=\\neal estate in West Houston and driving a Porsche to having to take a job se=\\nlling aluminum siding. Everybody was a kazillionaire,\" says Jaffe, \"and all=\\n of a sudden, everybody was bankrupt over the course of, like, three years.=\\n\" Banks just couldn't keep up with all the foreclosures on the suburban hou=\\nses stocked with '80s amenities -- the backyard swimming pool, the built-in=\\n wet bar and the Jacuzzi.=20\\nThe bust inspired a favorite Houston bumper-sticker, begging God for a seco=\\nnd chance, for another oil boom: \"God, if you bring it again, we won't scre=\\nw it up this time.\"=20\\nThings were so depressed circa 1986 that a volunteer civic organization cal=\\nled Houston Proud formed to try to cheer up the beleaguered populace. The H=\\nouston Proud theme song was a relentlessly upbeat ditty that tried too hard=\\n. Sample lyric: \"We're Houston Proud! Proud of the things we've done togeth=\\ner!\" Commercials aired on local TV pairing the song with chipper images of =\\nsmiling Houstonians to market Houston to its own people, as if to plead, \"P=\\nlease don't lose faith. Just don't move away.\"=20\\nAnd maybe that's where the inferiority complex comes from: This is a city t=\\nhat knows what it feels like to fall flat on your face, to go from driving =\\na Porsche to selling aluminum siding. Or maybe a city where the free-market=\\n conquers all knows it's inevitably a little rough around the edges.=20\\nCongratulations, Houston! You've just been named \"The Fattest City in Ameri=\\nca\" by Men's Fitness magazine for the second year in a row. To respond to t=\\nhe salvo, Mayor Brown recently launched a campaign to inspire Houstonians t=\\no slim down, by starting with his own waistline. If you can't rule by polic=\\ny, why not govern by example?=20\\nThe taxes are so low here that the city government needs a public referendu=\\nm to do anything beyond barely keeping the surface streets functional. Behi=\\nnd the scenes, it's businesspeople, both informally and through the Greater=\\n Houston Partnership, who push civic projects and sweetheart deals along, f=\\nrom downtown revitalization to building new stadiums. In Houston, the busin=\\ness agenda is the civic agenda.=20\\n\"The shadow government decided where the football stadium is going to be, h=\\now much public money was going to be put into it, and where the money would=\\n come from,\" explains Tarlov. Ken Lay led the approval process of the new b=\\naseball stadium, which now bears the name of his disgraced company.=20\\nThe sign that says Enron Field, which the now-bankrupt company pledged to p=\\nay $100 million for, is the most vivid symbol that Enron's shame is also a =\\nbig black eye for Houston. But neither Enron Field nor the Compaq Center --=\\n Compaq cut 8,500 jobs last spring and may still be absorbed by Hewlett-Pac=\\nkard -- has soured local politicians on the naming game. Right now, the Cit=\\ny Council is considering selling off different rooms of the new convention =\\ncenter for corporate branding.=20\\nHouston has struggled since the catastrophic oil bust of the '80s to change=\\n its wildcatting ways. And like an investor who learned her lesson the hard=\\n way when her 401K turned out to be composed 80 percent of Enron stock, Hou=\\nston has shed its overdependence on the energy industry, with some success.=\\n The city now boasts that while 82 percent of all economic activity in the =\\nearly '80s was energy-related, now it's about 49 percent. That still means =\\nit's a town whose fortunes are tied to the price of oil, just less so.=20\\nBut even with big local employers Compaq and Continental on the ropes, Enro=\\nn evaporating and the price of oil down from $30 a barrel in early 2000 to =\\n$18 a barrel today, the city has lost only 5,700 seasonably adjusted jobs, =\\naccording to the University of Houston's Institute for Regional Forecasting=\\n. That means while the country has shed about 1 percent of its job base in =\\nthe recession, even with Enron's fall, Houston has lost only a quarter perc=\\nent of its base. Houston may be down, but it is still ahead of the rest of =\\nthe country.=20\\nBut the collapse of Enron means something more here than the loss of jobs o=\\nr money or even face. Lay was the archetypal Good Houston Businessman: a yo=\\nung man from somewhere else who comes to town, makes a lot of money and sho=\\nwers it back on the community, while building his good name. He was widely =\\nthought to be a promising candidate for mayor when Brown's term expires on =\\nterm limits next year, prompting comparisons to Houston's great-granddaddy =\\nof civic business leaders, Jesse \"Mr. Houston\" Jones.=20\\nAnd before its collapse, Enron represented Houston's best idea of itself --=\\n an innovative, technocratic, deregulation innovator that might be a bit on=\\n the arrogant and greedy side but was also philanthropic and civic-minded, =\\na company transforming itself out of the oil and gas business into a new ec=\\nonomy conglomerate that even sold broadband services. Enron was the New Hou=\\nston.=20\\nNot even the city's official civic pride cheerleaders can entirely brush of=\\nf Enron. Lynn Nutt, chair of Houston Proud, confides: \"The self-esteem here=\\n in Houston is very depleted.\"=20\\nBut in a city that's always trying to prove itself, there's no time for nav=\\nel-gazing about whether Enron's collapse means that there's something inher=\\nent in Houston's culture that breeds such colossal screwups. The Houston wa=\\ny isn't to wallow and whine. It's to declare -- all together now! -- your p=\\nride in your city, while leaving the congressional investigators, the FBI a=\\nnd the courts to sort out that Enron mess. In bike-riding, eco-friendly, gr=\\nanola-eating Portland, Ore., they may be singing the \"Enron Blues,\" but her=\\ne in Houston, headquarters for the largest bankruptcy in history, they're s=\\ntill Houston Proud!=20\\nJust in time for all the Enron fuss, there's a new Houston Proud \"Rally Son=\\ng\" by local songwriter Phil Blackman: \"Houston is the Place to Be.\" It's a =\\ntwangy Texas two-step blues number with a country twist.=20\\n\"I've been up, I've been down,=20\\nSearchin' for a place to be=20\\nI've been around, the world you see=20\\nBut Houston is the place for me.\"=20\\nAh, the good-natured earnestness, the protesting-too-much! It's enough to m=\\nake the heart skip a beat for Houston, or maybe just make you want to skip =\\ntown.=20\\nsalon.com\\n\\n\\nTexas law firm working to weather Enron storm\\nVinson & Elkins, one of state's largest firms, faces hard questions on its =\\nwork for company\\nBy Bruce Hight\\nAmerican-Statesman Staff\\nFriday, February 1, 2002\\nFor now, at least, Vinson & Elkins LLP, the big Houston law firm that repre=\\nsented Enron Corp., sits quietly in the eye of the hurricane of outrage tha=\\nt stormed the city after the collapse of the energy giant into bankruptcy a=\\nnd scandal.\\nBut the investigations have only begun.\\nSo far, the firm says, it has not lost any clients and even continues to re=\\npresent Enron on some matters, although it says Enron owes the firm $5 mill=\\nion for past services.\\nAnd while Vinson & Elkins faces questions about its role in the creation an=\\nd operation of the partnerships that contributed to Enron's failure, the fi=\\nrm - one of the largest in the state - has not been directly implicated in =\\nEnron's collapse.\\nThat's a marked contrast to Arthur Andersen LLP, which was fired as Enron's=\\n auditor last month and has fired one of its own top partners. It has also =\\nacknowledged destroying Enron-related records and admitted this week that i=\\nt has lost clients. Some analysts have suggested that Andersen might be so =\\nheavily damaged that it will have to seek a merger with another accounting =\\nfirm.\\nHarry Reasoner, who was Vinson & Elkins' managing partner until the end of =\\nlast year, said the law firm is not free to comment in detail about its wor=\\nk for Enron because of attorney-client privilege.\\n\"It is particularly frustrating because we're confident that when the full =\\nfacts come out that it will be clear that we have conducted ourselves in a =\\nmanner that is both professional and is required by our ethical obligations=\\n,\" he said.\\nOne aspect of the firm's work for Enron already has raised eyebrows: At Enr=\\non's request, it investigated internal warnings last fall of possible wrong=\\ndoing involving some of the partnerships that eventually led to the company=\\n's bankruptcy, despite a warning that Vinson & Elkins had previously provid=\\ned some legal advice pertaining to the partnerships.\\nOutside legal experts agree that it's too soon to tell whether the firm act=\\ned legally and ethically. But that doesn't mean it has nothing to worry abo=\\nut, they added.\\n\"Even if Vinson & Elkins is determined to have no legal liability in this m=\\natter, its reputation has been tarnished,\" said Milton \"Mitt\" Regan, who te=\\naches a course on professional responsibility and corporate lawyers at Geor=\\ngetown University Law Center in Washington.\\nOne issue, Regan said, is just what role Vinson & Elkins played in the crea=\\ntion of the partnerships that were used by Enron to move debt off its own b=\\nooks, which apparently benefited some Enron executives and helped lead to b=\\nankruptcy.\\n\"We will need to know whether Vinson & Elkins was confined to the narrow ta=\\nsk of opining on the legality of business proposals that others developed, =\\nor whether it took a more expansive role as a member of the team that devel=\\noped business strategies,\" Regan said in an e-mail interview.\\nJohn Dzienkowski, a University of Texas law professor who also teaches prof=\\nessional responsibility, said even if Vinson & Elkins did nothing wrong, th=\\ne firm probably won't avoid legal action against it.\\n\"Given their deep pockets and high profile, they're likely to be targets of=\\n plaintiffs looking for remedies,\" he said.\\nJust last August, another prominent Texas law firm, Locke Liddell & Sapp LL=\\nP, paid $8.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought against it by investors of=\\n Brian Russell Stearns, who was convicted of running a phony investment sca=\\nm. And in April 2000, the same firm agreed to pay $22 million to settle a l=\\nawsuit brought by investors in Austin Forex International, a failed foreign=\\n currency firm run by former UT football star Russell Erxleben.\\nInvestors claimed that Locke Liddell helped Stearns and Erxleben defraud th=\\nem. Locke Liddell denied any wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid length=\\ny and expensive litigation - a decision that Vinson & Elkins may face event=\\nually, said Dzienkowski.\\nStill, he said, Vinson & Elkins' professional reputation is so strong that =\\nhe doubts it will suffer permanent harm.\\nTo make sure, Vinson & Elkins has hired some of the top names in the legal =\\nprofession to defend it. One is Joe Jamail, a renowned Houston trial lawyer=\\n better known for battling firms such as Vinson & Elkins than helping them.=\\n But Jamail already has persuaded plaintiffs' lawyers in two lawsuits again=\\nst Enron to drop Vinson & Elkins as a defendant.\\nAnother top gun hired by Vinson & Elkins is John Villa, of the top Washingt=\\non firm of Williams & Connolly LLP. He specializes in defending prominent l=\\naw firms.\\nReasoner said Villa is overseeing Vinson & Elkins' cooperation with the var=\\nious investigations: \"I don't believe in our lawyers representing themselve=\\ns when they're called on to testify as witnesses.\"\\nFounded in 1917, Vinson & Elkins is the second-largest law firm in Texas, a=\\nccording to a survey last year by a trade publication, Texas Lawyer. It has=\\n 860 lawyers, including 110 in its Austin office, making it one of the city=\\n's largest law firms. (Don Wood, partner in charge of the Austin office, sa=\\nid none of the Austin lawyers were assigned to Enron.) It also has offices =\\nin other cities, including Dallas, Washington, London, Moscow and Singapore=\\n.\\nIts revenues last year were about $455 million.\\n\"Enron was only 7-plus percent of our revenue,\" Reasoner said. \"That's sign=\\nificant, but I mean, it's not material to us economically in the sense of h=\\narming us. And of course people are upset by reading unpleasant publicity. =\\nBut I don't think anyone is concerned that it will affect us in the long ru=\\nn.\"\\nVinson & Elkins is the kind of firm people have in mind when they talk abou=\\nt \"establishment\" or \"white shoe\" lawyers, those representing banks, major =\\ncorporations, insurers and wealthy individuals.\\nIt is well-connected, politically and otherwise. Al Gonzales, general couns=\\nel to President Bush and a former Texas Supreme Court justice, is a former =\\nVinson & Elkins partner. And some of Enron's 200-plus in-house lawyers used=\\n to work at Vinson & Elkins, including the company's general counsel, James=\\n Derrick.\\n(Another major Houston law firm that has done work for Enron, Bracewell & P=\\natterson, has severed all ties with the company. Two of its partners, Marc =\\nRacicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Greg Abbott, a =\\ncandidate for Texas attorney general, have been criticized for their links =\\nto a firm working for Enron.)\\nVinson & Elkins recruits some of the top law school graduates in the countr=\\ny - first-year associates start at $110,000 - and the firm, as well as Enro=\\nn, has contributed to the UT Law School foundation. Reasoner serves on the =\\nfoundation's board, as did Derrick until October.\\nThose connections have attracted some criticism of the Law School dean, Wil=\\nliam Powers, after he was elected last year to the Enron board and named ch=\\nairman of a special committee to investigate the company's finances. Powers=\\n has denied any conflict.\\nThe most obvious cloud on Vinson & Elkins' Enron dealings at this point app=\\nears to be the investigation it undertook last fall, at Enron's request, re=\\ngarding warnings from an Enron executive that the company could \"implode in=\\n a wave of accounting scandals.\"\\nThe executive, Sherron Watkins, also advised former Enron Chairman Ken Lay =\\nnot to use Vinson & Elkins for the investigation because it had provided le=\\ngal advice in the past to some of the entities whose actions she was questi=\\noning.=20\\nMost of her concerns, however, centered on the accounting of the transactio=\\nns between the partnerships and Enron, warning that although they had the b=\\nlessing of Arthur Andersen, \"none of that will protect Enron if these trans=\\nactions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day.\"\\nBut Enron nevertheless selected Vinson & Elkins, which on Oct. 15 sent a se=\\nven-page letter to company executives that reported no apparent law-breakin=\\ng and advised that there was no need to hire independent counsel or auditor=\\ns.=20\\nHowever, it warned that some of the transactions in question had \"bad cosme=\\ntics,\" with \"a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation.\"\\nReasoner said that Watkins' warnings did have an effect; Enron afterward ac=\\nknowledged the problems and reported publicly its major financial losses.\\nAnd he hints that Vinson & Elkins did more than suggested by its report: \"T=\\nhe notion that this was a whitewash or that the company didn't deal with it=\\n - I'm not free to say what our oral advice is or why they did what they di=\\nd, but they certainly did deal with it.\"\\nAnd, Reasoner said, the firm \"was not asked to examine our own legal work\" =\\nin the investigation.\\nOthers will, however, including Congress and the Securities and Exchange Co=\\nmmission.\\nYou may contact Bruce Hight at bhight@statesman.com or (512) 445-3977.=20\\n=20\\n\\nNew Prosecutor Is an `Iron Fist In a Velvet Glove'\\nBy Jerry Markon\\nStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n02/01/2002\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nB1\\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nWhen James Comey was a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va., he riled up the=\\n area's three federal judges in a way that prosecutors rarely do. In a high=\\nly unusual joint opinion, the judges criticized Mr. Comey's pet project to =\\ncrack down on gun crimes by prosecuting them in federal courts, where sente=\\nncing was tougher, rather than state courts.=20\\n\"It's a total intrusion on the sovereign state of Virginia,\" Richard Willia=\\nms, one of the judges, says in an interview. At the same time, he adds: \"I =\\nhave a very high regard for Jim Comey. . . . He did an outstanding job.\"\\nSuch sentiment is often heard about Mr. Comey, who is expected to be confir=\\nmed soon by the Senate as the new U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Imposing at 6=\\n-foot-8 and reputed for his tenacity, Mr. Comey -- who's been involved in h=\\nighly charged cases from terrorism to an earlier Enron Corp. case -- seems =\\nthe classic tough-as-nails prosecutor. But as one Richmond defense lawyer, =\\nSteven Benjamin, puts it, Mr. Comey is \"an iron fist in a velvet glove. He'=\\ns extremely pleasant, but if you challenge him, you go to war. He will not =\\nyield an inch on something that matters to him.\"=20\\nAllan Applbaum, a former New York federal prosecutor who worked with Mr. Co=\\nmey in the early 1990s, notes: \"He has this combination of strength and boy=\\nish charm that really does disarm people.\"=20\\nMr. Comey, 41 years old, will need these qualities in his new job, which he=\\n began on an interim basis last month. With its focus on Wall Street crime,=\\n the Mafia and, in recent years, terrorism, Manhattan's federal prosecutor =\\nis traditionally the most visible of the country's 93 U.S. attorneys.=20\\nBut since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has centralized terrorism inves=\\ntigations in Washington, saying the events required a coordinated national =\\nresponse. It's a significant change: Since the first World Trade Center att=\\nack in 1993, most major terrorism cases had been handled in New York. Now, =\\nkey terrorism cases are being filed in Mr. Comey's old district in Virginia=\\n.=20\\nA native of Yonkers, N.Y., Mr. Comey won the attention of Attorney General =\\nJohn Ashcroft and President Bush with accomplishments such as his quick ind=\\nictment last year of 14 men in the 1996 terrorist bombing of military barra=\\ncks in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 American airmen. FBI officials had bee=\\nn frustrated at the slow pace of the government's investigation, and reques=\\nted that the case be transferred to Mr. Comey, who was then in Richmond.=20\\nAs an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan during the early 1990s, Mr. Come=\\ny won guilty pleas from two former executives of Enron's oil-trading subsid=\\niary to charges of conspiring to defraud the parent company through a serie=\\ns of phony oil- trading contracts. He also oversaw the hunt for fugitive Ma=\\nrc Rich, who was later pardoned by President Clinton.=20\\nMr. Comey recalls a 1992 trip to a mountaintop hotel in Zurich, Switzerland=\\n, expecting to meet Mr. Rich and his lawyers to arrange the fugitive's surr=\\nender. But Mr. Rich's side argued instead that the racketeering and tax-eva=\\nsion charges he faced had no merit, and Switzerland had already refused the=\\n U.S.'s extradition request.=20\\n\"It was a bit frustrating. We felt we had wasted an enormous amount of time=\\n,\" Mr. Comey says. \"The chocolates were lovely though.\"=20\\nMr. Comey had more success with his gun-crime program in Virginia starting =\\nin the mid-'90s. Facing concerns that Project Exile was anti-black because =\\nmost gun crimes involve blacks, he met with the critical federal judges and=\\n community leaders to emphasize that the program would help victims. He eve=\\nntually won widespread support for the program, which helped cut the murder=\\n rate in Richmond by half. At least 12 other cities, including Baltimore an=\\nd Oakland, Calif., have started their own version of Project Exile.=20\\nMr. Comey calls his new position \"a dream job,\" and seems confident that th=\\ne New York office's central role in prosecuting high-profile cases will be =\\nmaintained. \"There's always a healthy tension between an aggressive, indepe=\\nndent U.S. attorney's office and headquarters [in Washington], but I don't =\\nsee any kind of sea change,\" he says.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lublin\\nStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n02/01/2002\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\nC1\\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\\n\\nWhen the board audit committee of Enron Corp. gathered for a regular meetin=\\ng at its Houston headquarters a year ago, the session should have been anyt=\\nhing but routine.=20\\nAfter all, Enron management wanted a blessing for every transaction during =\\n2000 between the energy-trading company and two partnerships run by then-Ch=\\nief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The controversial partnerships kept si=\\ngnificant debt off the books, pumped up profits -- and earned Mr. Fastow mo=\\nre than $30 million.\\nYet committee members, all of them outside directors, didn't challenge a si=\\nngle transaction, according to knowledgeable people and excerpts of the Feb=\\n. 12 meeting's minutes. Their indifference wasn't a complete surprise. The =\\nfull board twice had taken the rare step of suspending the corporate-ethics=\\n code, so Mr. Fastow could head the partnerships.=20\\nSubsequent disclosure of losses related to the partnerships hastened Enron'=\\ns collapse. Now, amid finger-pointing at top management and the company's o=\\nutside auditors at Arthur Andersen LLP, the audit committee is under harsh =\\nscrutiny from a slew of civil, criminal and congressional investigations --=\\n and the board itself.=20\\nA special board committee looking into the debacle is expected to partly bl=\\name the six-member audit panel in a report to be issued as early as this we=\\nekend. The report will cite slick presentations by sophisticated financial =\\npeople along with lethargy on the part of audit-committee members, says an =\\nindividual close to the situation. The panel discovered significant defects=\\n in procedures for monitoring financial results and controls, the individua=\\nl adds.=20\\nCritics who contend Enron's audit panel fell short cite several key reasons=\\n: Several members held cozy ties with the company, they say. The panel's ch=\\nairman -- Robert K. Jaedicke, retired accounting professor and former dean =\\nof Stanford University's business school -- preferred a relatively passive =\\nrole. And Andersen auditors apparently weren't persuaded that they should b=\\ne answerable to the audit committee as their client. \"It's the worst audit =\\ncommittee I have ever seen,\" asserts John Nash, president emeritus of the N=\\national Association of Corporate Directors.=20\\n\"This audit committee worked pretty well based on the information it was pr=\\novided,\" retorts W. Neil Eggleston, counsel for Enron's outside directors a=\\nnd a partner at Howrey Simon Arnold & White in Washington. Andersen signed =\\noff on accounting practices and didn't alert members about \"any impropriety=\\n or irregularity\" until November, Mr. Eggleston adds. Audit-committee membe=\\nrs either declined to comment about their role or didn't return calls.=20\\nAn Andersen spokesman, asked to respond to Mr. Eggleston's critique, said t=\\nhe notion that \"the audit committee or senior management wasn't aware of th=\\ne risks of the business decisions they were making is entirely implausible.=\\n\" Regarding criticism of its auditing work, Andersen says Enron withheld cr=\\nucial information and misled the auditors about the partnerships; Enron fir=\\ned Andersen last month.=20\\nAt first glance, Enron's pivotal audit panel, made up of prominent executiv=\\nes, looks well-qualified. But in reality, governance specialists contend, t=\\nhe committee's makeup is far from ideal.=20\\nFor one thing, half its members live abroad -- an uncommon practice at audi=\\nt panels, which meet often and require a keen grasp of business practices h=\\nere. As an American citizen, Hong Kong billionaire property developer Ronni=\\ne Chan may understand U.S. business. But he has the worst recent attendance=\\n record of any Enron director. He missed more than 25% of board and committ=\\nee meetings during 1996, 1997 and 2000, according to proxy statements. (In =\\n1998 and 1999 he missed fewer meetings, though the percentage wasn't report=\\ned because it was less than 25%.)=20\\nCorporate-governance experts doubt some other audit-committee members are t=\\nruly independent. Lord John Wakeham joined the board in 1994, four years af=\\nter the then-British energy secretary approved plans for Enron to build a p=\\nower plant in the United Kingdom. Since 1996, proxy statements show, he has=\\n earned $72,000 a year advising its European unit -- more than his $50,000 =\\nannual stipend for being a director. In a statement last week, Lord Wakeham=\\n's office said it \"would clearly be wrong of him\" to make any comments abou=\\nt his position at Enron while the matter is being investigated.=20\\nJohn Mendelsohn is president of University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Ce=\\nnter, which has received nearly $1.6 million in donations from Enron and re=\\nlated entities since 1985, the year his predecessor Charles A. LeMaistre be=\\ncame an Enron director. Dr. Mendelsohn has said the center doesn't depend h=\\neavily on Enron philanthropy.=20\\nDr. Jaedicke, who is 73 years old, is the most important -- and, to corpora=\\nte governance experts, perhaps most problematic -- member of Enron's audit =\\npanel. The unpretentious retired academic commands respect for his meticulo=\\nus thoroughness. But he has led the Enron audit panel since he obtained his=\\n board seat in 1985. Big-business boards typically switch committee heads e=\\nvery three to five years to maintain distance from management.=20\\nDr. Jaedicke feels his lengthy tenure never crimped his outside perspective=\\n, Mr. Eggleston says. But some question whether Dr. Jaedicke's long service=\\n to Enron may have contributed to his approach.=20\\nHe took a relatively passive role, for example, when the board first waived=\\n the ethics code in mid-1999. To form a private partnership called LJM Caym=\\nan LP, Mr. Fastow needed a special board ruling that his activities wouldn'=\\nt violate policies intended to protect against executives being involved in=\\n activities that might pose a conflict of interest or harm Enron.=20\\nThe audit committee's charter, disclosed in the latest proxy statement, des=\\ncribes its responsibility for overseeing ethics-code compliance. Yet the pa=\\nnel took no action about suspending the code before the full board met; nor=\\n did Dr. Jaedicke propose an audit-committee review during that board meeti=\\nng, Mr. Eggleston reports.=20\\n\"The audit committee should have made the code suspension part of their wor=\\nk, especially since the partnership would involve the CFO,\" says Charles El=\\nson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of D=\\nelaware's business school. And Dr. Jaedicke, as the committee's chairman, \"=\\nshould have been upset over the proposed waiver of the code.\"=20\\nTo the contrary, according to excerpted minutes from Enron's board meeting =\\non June 28, 1999, it was Dr. Jaedicke who seconded the motion suspending th=\\ne ethics code when directors approved a resolution that Mr. Fastow's partne=\\nrship participation \"will not adversely affect the interests of the Company=\\n.\"=20\\nHe saw the partnership as a \"one-off, isolated transaction. It didn't look =\\nlike there was much risk at that time,\" Mr. Eggleston explains. In addition=\\n, the lawyer continues, committee members \"believed that Arthur Andersen wa=\\ns involved in blessing the LJM partnerships.\"=20\\nAlso raising eyebrows is the audit committee's lack of involvement in decid=\\ning which law firm would conduct the nearly two-month probe into a letter w=\\narning of questionable accounting last August by Enron Vice President Sherr=\\non Watkins. Her letter raised alarms about the unorthodox partnerships and =\\ntheir potential danger to Enron's finances and public image.=20\\nAt numerous companies, the audit-committee chairman decides which law firm =\\nshould probe a serious whistle-blowing complaint. \"That's the only way you =\\nmaintain the integrity of the company,\" says Roderick M. Hills, a former Se=\\ncurities and Exchange Commission chairman who has led more than six audit c=\\nommittees.=20\\nInstead, at Enron, management made the decision to retain Houston law firm =\\nVinson & Elkins to explore concerns described in the letter Ms. Watkins sen=\\nt and discussed with then-chairman Kenneth Lay. Her letter cautioned agains=\\nt using Vinson & Elkins as investigators because it had issued legal opinio=\\nns endorsing some of the partnerships.=20\\nDr. Jaedicke didn't learn about the Watkins letter or the outside lawyers' =\\ninquiry until it ended, when Vinson & Elkins briefed him about the finding,=\\n Mr. Eggleston says. He maintains this didn't bother Dr. Jaedicke because h=\\ne knew corporate policy required that in-house attorneys review employee co=\\nmplaints from any level and decide whether to seek outside legal help. Crit=\\nics say that the Vinson & Elkins Oct. 15 report in effect ignored the accou=\\nnting problems, by concluding that Enron's practice of forming special-purp=\\nose entities to keep debt off its books was \"creative and aggressive\" but w=\\nasn't \"inappropriate from a technical standpoint.\"=20\\nEnron's auditors also knew about the Watkins allegations long before the au=\\ndit committee did. An Aug. 21 Andersen memo summarizes a conversation in wh=\\nich the whistle-blowing executive, a former Andersen auditor, shared her co=\\nncerns about Enron's questionable accounting with an Andersen audit partner=\\n not assigned there. The partner passed along what he termed \"a very troubl=\\nesome scenario\" to several Enron auditors at Andersen and to the firm's law=\\nyers. Andersen says it also informed Enron management.=20\\nBy Oct. 9, Andersen analysts had determined there was \"a red alert: a heigh=\\ntened risk of financial-statement fraud\" at Enron, according to an Andersen=\\n e-mail. The Andersen spokesman says the financial-statement test described=\\n in the e-mail was conducted on an \"experimental basis\" using software late=\\nr found to be flawed and doesn't know what actions auditors took to address=\\n the \"red alert.\"=20\\nAgain, however, Enron's audit committee didn't immediately learn of this. N=\\not until Nov. 2, when the company's financial condition had seriously deter=\\niorated, did Andersen tell the Enron board of \"possible illegal acts within=\\n the company\" concerning one partnership, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph B=\\nerardino told lawmakers. Six days later, the complex partnerships caused En=\\nron to restate nearly $600 million in earnings reported over five years.=20\\nSome suspect Andersen auditors failed to keep Enron's audit committee well-=\\ninformed because they saw their main responsibility as serving the company'=\\ns management, and not the full board or the audit committee. \"It's usually =\\nthe comptroller that recommends to the audit committee who the auditors sho=\\nuld be,\" a former Enron official observes. Andersen auditors worked \"with t=\\nhe company day by day. They saw the audit committee once a quarter.\"=20\\nYet at some companies audit-panel chairmen aggressively try to reverse that=\\n misconception, thereby protecting auditors against management mischief. \"Y=\\nou're there to make sure [auditors] report to you\" and that only directors =\\ncan fire them, Mr. Hills says. So, he occasionally spends all day at audito=\\nrs' offices making sure they consider conservative accounting methods. \"Enr=\\non is emblematic of a culture in corporate life that needs to be rooted out=\\n,\" he maintains.=20\\n---=20\\nChristopher Cooper, Peter Wonacott, Matt Pottinger and Jonathan Karp contri=\\nbuted to this article.=20\\n---=20\\nJournal Link: What should investors know about \"impairment\" charges appeari=\\nng on some company balance sheets?

But frankly, the dean's moral comp=\\nass is not the issue in the debate over whether he should lead Enron's inte=\\nrnal investigation of what went wrong with the Houston-based energy trader.=\\n=20\\nPublic trust is the issue.=20\\nPowers is a member of the Enron board. His law school has close ties to Enr=\\non and its money. The dean is probing partnerships that hid the company's l=\\nosses. As lead investigator, Powers will issue a report on the nature of th=\\nose transactions.=20\\nThe goal of the investigation -- to get to the bottom of Enron's financial =\\nscandal -- clearly is compromised with Powers at the helm. Powers should st=\\nep down from that role to ensure that there can be no questioning or doubt =\\nabout the objectivity of the inquiry. Enron, a publicly traded company, owe=\\ns its shareholders an investigation. Investors, out-of-work employees and o=\\nthers are entitled to a comprehensive probe that steers clear of conflicts =\\n-- even perceived ones.=20\\nThat is why the Enron board should hire a third party with no ties to the c=\\nompany for the job.=20\\nThe larger principle at stake in the board's investigation is public confid=\\nence. U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft as well as Texas Attorney General=\\n John Cornyn set an example by recusing themselves from investigating Enron=\\n, which contributed heavily to both. Ashcroft lost his U.S. Senate seat las=\\nt year in his native Missouri. Ashcroft and Cornyn wisely understood that t=\\nhe issue was not whether they could conduct fair investigations, but whethe=\\nr the public would trust their investigations given their financial ties to=\\n Enron and its former CEO, Ken Lay.=20\\nThat is the issue at the heart of the debate over Powers. Unfortunately, th=\\ne Enron board doesn't seem to get it. It downplays ties between Enron and U=\\nT, including the close connection between Powers and top Enron executive Ja=\\nmes Derrick Jr.=20\\nDerrick is a major fund-raiser for the UT law school and, until recently, w=\\nas a member of its Law School Foundation that supplements Powers' UT salary=\\n. He resigned after Powers joined the Enron board.=20\\nAfter Enron made the last installment of its $250,000 pledge to the UT law =\\nschool last year, Powers sent Derrick a handwritten note, \"Thank you for al=\\nl you do for us!\"=20\\nThe Enron-UT-Powers connections go deeper. Houston-based Vinson & Elkins, w=\\nith offices in Austin, is a generous donor to the law school. Enron is one =\\nof the firm's major clients.=20\\nWe wanted to discuss these issues with Powers. But we were referred to Kare=\\nn Denne, an Enron public relations representative in Houston.=20\\nDenne said the board doesn't see anything wrong with Powers heading the inv=\\nestigation. It appointed him to the board last fall for that very purpose, =\\nshe said. The company had begun its financial free fall when Powers joined =\\nthe board in October.=20\\n\"The board specifically brought Dean Powers on board to head up this specia=\\nl investigation so we would have a comprehensive, independent review and in=\\nvestigation of the partnerships in question.\"=20\\nDenne added that the board concluded, \"Powers' credentials and reputation i=\\nn the legal field outweigh any perceived legal conflict.\"=20\\nIt's not the board's view that matters most. It's the public's, and the pub=\\nlic is not likely to trust a report produced by someone with Powers' connec=\\ntions to Enron. Then there are the real people who got hurt -- former Enron=\\n employees, teachers and others who saw their pensions and life savings eva=\\nporate as Enron stock crashed. They are even less likely to trust an inquir=\\ny by Powers.=20\\nThose are legitimate doubts.

White, the secretary of the Army, vigorous=\\nly defended today the business practices of a major Enron division that he =\\nhelped manage until early last year, rejecting in an interview assertions b=\\ny former employees that there was improper accounting at the unit.=20\\nMr. White and Enron officials said that the division, Enron Energy Services=\\n, was getting out of the business of providing energy services to military =\\nbases before Mr. White was named Army secretary last spring. As a result, M=\\nr. White said, he has not needed to disqualify himself from any decisions r=\\nelating to Enron after he took office in May.\\nSeveral former employees of Enron Energy Services have said that while Mr. =\\nWhite was vice chairman of the unit, it overstated its profits by hundreds =\\nof millions of dollars, using shoddy accounting practices to create illusor=\\ny earnings. Those assertions have come under scrutiny by several committees=\\n on Capitol Hill investigating Enron's collapse.=20\\nMr. White denied the ex-employees' accusations. ''As far as I am concerned,=\\n Enron Energy Services was a great business,'' he said in an interview that=\\n ranged widely across military issues and the Enron matter. ''We built it f=\\nrom nothing. There were no accounting irregularities that I was aware of.''=\\n=20\\nQuestions about Enron Energy Services became public last week with news rep=\\norts of an e-mail message sent last year by a former employee, Margaret Cec=\\noni, to Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman at the time. Ms. Ceconi, a former =\\nsales manager, said that Enron Energy Services had hidden losses on contrac=\\nts worth more than $500 million.=20\\n''This is common knowledge among all the E.E.S. employees, and is actually =\\njoked about,'' she said in the message, dated Aug. 29, 2001. Since Enron's =\\nbankruptcy filing in December, Enron Energy Services has laid off most of i=\\nts 1,000 employees and walked away from many of its contracts. Those includ=\\ne a $25 million contract to provide services to Fort Hamilton in New York t=\\nhat Enron won when Mr. White, a retired Army brigadier general, was a compa=\\nny executive.=20\\nThe Army is in negotiations with Enron Energy Services over its default on =\\nthe Fort Hamilton contract.=20\\nOther former employees have said that the division used aggressive projecti=\\nons and accounting to overstate earnings during Mr. White's tenure. The emp=\\nloyees said that they did not know whether Mr. White or Lou L. Pai, the uni=\\nt's chairman at the time, were aware of this.=20\\nOn Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to Mr. =\\nLay asking him to explain what Enron did in response to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail=\\n message.=20\\nSenator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the investigatio=\\nns subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, also raised q=\\nuestions about Mr. White's financial ties to Enron in a letter to the Offic=\\ne of Government Ethics. Mr. Levin's office said today that he had not recei=\\nved a response from the ethics office.=20\\nIn the interview today, Mr. White dismissed Ms. Ceconi's claims of impropri=\\neties, and he argued that most of her e-mail message was devoted to complai=\\nnts about how the company had treated her. Her personal complaints seemed v=\\nalid, he said, though he suggested that the management team that succeeded =\\nhim was responsible for her problems.=20\\n''I think she has a case from what I know about it and what I've read about=\\n it that her employment at Enron was not properly handled,'' Mr. White said=\\n. ''She was recruited into a specific area of the business, and the new lea=\\ndership team at Enron Energy Service decided to head the business in a new =\\ndirection. Unfortunately, she got caught in the middle of it.''=20\\nIn the e-mail message, Ms. Ceconi said she was recruited to leave her job a=\\nt GE Capital by Enron Energy Services with promises of a compensation packa=\\nge worth as much $1 million a year. Instead, she was laid off in less than =\\na year as the company began to crumble. Ms. Ceconi did not return calls for=\\n comment.=20\\nWhile Mr. White was at Enron Energy Services, the company created a unit ca=\\nlled Enron Federal Solutions that aggressively pursued contracts with the P=\\nentagon to provide energy services at military bases. Congress had authoriz=\\ned the privatization of utility services at bases in 1997, and the followin=\\ng year the secretary of defense, William S. Cohen, ordered the armed servic=\\nes to try to privatize electric, natural gas and other utilities at all bas=\\nes by 2003.=20\\nA spokeswoman for Enron Energy Services said that by March 2001, before Mr.=\\n White was nominated to be Army secretary, the division had already decided=\\n to stop bidding on military contracts. At the time, the company had bid on=\\n five contracts to provide services to about a dozen bases, including some =\\nArmy bases.=20\\nWhen Mr. White took office, he strongly endorsed the Army's energy privatiz=\\nation policy. Some consumer groups, including Public Citizen, have raised q=\\nuestions about possible conflict of interest.=20\\nIn a letter last week to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the =\\nranking Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform, Mr. White sai=\\nd he had been in contact with 13 different Enron employees, including Mr. L=\\nay, on 29 occasions since taking office. But Mr. White said that all of tho=\\nse contacts had been personal in nature.=20\\nToday, Mr. White said that no decisions regarding Enron had come to his off=\\nice. ''I have taken no action at any point or at any time that would benefi=\\nt Enron corporations in any way with utilities privatization or any other e=\\nndeavor,'' he said.=20\\nAccording to government disclosure filings, Mr. White's final salary at Enr=\\non was $5.5 million. To comply with ethics rules, he was compelled to sell =\\n405,710 shares of Enron last year at prices ranging from $50 to $12.85 a sh=\\nare, well below the stock's peak. Still, he received $12 million.=20\\n''I guess I would say that there is a terrible tragedy that has unfolded th=\\nere,'' Mr. White said today. ''I have many friends, as well as myself, who =\\nhave suffered losses.''\\n\\nPhoto: Thomas E.

Former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman=\\n Arthur Levitt Jr. feared that auditors would be reluctant to get tough wit=\\nh clients and risk losing lucrative consulting work.=20\\nIn 2000, Levitt tried to ban auditors from providing information technology=\\n and consulting services, and from conducting internal audits for their cli=\\nents.=20\\nKPMG, Deloitte & Touche, Arthur Andersen and the AICPA opposed that effort,=\\n threatening to go to court to block the SEC. Ultimately, they got lawmaker=\\ns to pressure Levitt to back off.=20\\nNow, however, the Enron scandal and other corporate accounting blowups have=\\n cost investors billions of dollars and created a new political climate for=\\n reform.=20\\nStephen G. Butler, chief executive of KPMG, said he hoped that by lifting i=\\nts opposition, the industry could steer the regulatory debate away from aud=\\nitor independence and the services limitations Levitt had wanted, which he =\\ncalled \"a red herring\" for the profession.=20\\nBarry Melancon, the AICPA president who was also a fierce critic of Levitt'=\\ns efforts, said he believes that limiting the type of services that an audi=\\nt firm can perform would not have prevented the Enron meltdown. But Melanco=\\nn said industry representatives recognize that the auditor independence iss=\\nue is \"front and center.\"=20\\n\"We need the profession to address it,\" he said. \"If we didn't address thes=\\ne two issues, people would be saying that we are trying to deflect. We are =\\nsaying we are stepping up to the plate first.\"=20\\nAndersen, which has been criticized for its handling of Enron's audits, als=\\no decided yesterday to drop its opposition to the scope-of-services restric=\\ntions. \"Andersen went voluntarily before Congress in December and made a co=\\nmmitment that it would look at its practices and that it would be making ch=\\nanges,\" said Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard. \"We are pleased to say the=\\n direction the industry is moving toward is something Andersen supports.\"=\\n=20\\nDeloitte & Touche, the other major accounting firm that had opposed Levitt'=\\ns ban, did not follow Andersen and KPMG yesterday.

PwC officials said y=\\nesterday that they decided to speed up their plans for an initial public of=\\nfering for PwC Consulting because of the current concerns about auditor ind=\\nependence. PwC's IPO plans were first reported in the Wall Street Journal.=\\n=20\\nLawmakers said it's unclear whether these various moves by accounting firms=\\n will be sufficient to head off legislative actions. \"I'm delighted by thei=\\nr conversion, but too little, too late,\" said Rep.

But she kept a Sept. 20 speaking engagemen=\\nt to a Christian women's gathering in Houston. Then, in what aides called a=\\n \"last-minute decision,\" she agreed to let Kenneth L.

North Carolina Democrats today begin airing a =\\nTV ad attacking Dole for the Enron event, making her the first prominent po=\\nlitician to be targeted by a well-financed effort for having connections to=\\n the bankrupt energy company.=20\\nShe is unlikely to be the last.=20\\nIn Colorado, Connecticut, Texas and other states, the Enron scandal has see=\\nped into state and congressional races, forcing Republicans to defend even =\\nmodest brushes with the company now under widespread investigation. The tar=\\ngets include the president's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where the s=\\ntate pension fund lost $325 million when Enron stock plummeted last fall.=\\n=20\\nIt is unclear whether the criticisms will stick, let alone influence voters=\\n nine months from now. Even some Democratic strategists urge caution, notin=\\ng that many Democrats also have accepted Enron money. But with polls showin=\\ng high presidential approval ratings -- along with greater voter confidence=\\n in Republicans than in Democrats on an array of issues -- some Democrats s=\\nee the unfolding Enron saga as their best hope for a surge in the November =\\nelections.=20\\n\"Enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002=\\n, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and =\\nRepublicans,\" three well-known Democratic advisers wrote in a recent memo t=\\no members of Congress. \"The more people hear, the more corrosive it becomes=\\n,\" wrote James Carville, Stanley Greenberg and Robert Shrum.=20\\nNorth Carolina may provide the first test. Dole, a former Cabinet member an=\\nd one-time presidential contender, is strongly favored to win the GOP nomin=\\nation to succeed retiring Sen. Jesse Helms (R). Democrats haven't settled o=\\nn a nominee, but they have eagerly criticized Dole for collecting $20,000 a=\\nt Lay's luncheon.=20\\nDole has given $5,000 of that amount -- which came directly from Lay or his=\\n relatives -- to a special fund for displaced Enron employees. But that has=\\nn't stopped a barrage of news stories and critical editorials.=20\\nNow comes the Democratic TV ad, to air in three North Carolina cities over =\\n12 days. It says Dole attended \"a secret fundraiser\" hosted by Lay. It quot=\\nes a Winston-Salem Journal editorial that said, \"while Dole's campaign was =\\npublicly stating it had put its activities on hold, it was conducting fundr=\\naisers at the house of a scoundrel.\"=20\\nIn a section not cited in the ad, the editorial also said, \"The state Democ=\\nratic Party, which has looked silly trying to find mud to throw at Dole, ha=\\ns uncovered a whole puddle.\" The Houston fundraiser \"shows that Dole is one=\\n more politician into whom Lay appears to have sunk his financial claws.\"=\\n=20\\nDemocrats note Dole's campaign hired Washington-based consultant Edward Gil=\\nlespie, a key Enron link to Republican House leaders and the White House. C=\\nampaign sources said Gillespie's Enron lobbying did not overlap with his wo=\\nrk for Dole and he was not involved in the Houston fundraiser.=20\\nIn Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to get out in front of his potential En=\\nron problem. The governor, who is seeking reelection this fall, has joined =\\nothers in calling for an investigation of the state employee pension fund's=\\n $325 million loss in Enron stock. Much of the stock was bought after Oct. =\\n22, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned it was investig=\\nating the company.=20\\nBush is one of three board members who oversee the fund. He joined Florida =\\nAttorney General Robert A. \"Bob\" Butterworth (D) in calling for an inquiry =\\nfocusing on Alliance Capital Management LP, the New York firm that made the=\\n Enron purchases.=20\\nThrough Alliance, the pension fund paid $9 to $82 a share for Enron stock, =\\nwhich it sold for 28 cents a share on Nov. 30, according to Florida news ac=\\ncounts. While newspapers have noted the governor's role in overseeing the p=\\nension fund, Democrats are moving cautiously.=20\\nFlorida Democratic Chairman Bob Poe said, \"Right now, I don't see where [Bu=\\nsh] had control of Alliance Capital. Maybe someone shows me how he should b=\\ne responsible, but right now, I don't see that.\"=20\\nPoe was more critical of Bush's decision to attend a January fundraiser for=\\n the Florida GOP at the Houston home of Richard D. Kinder, who was presiden=\\nt of Enron until 1996.=20\\n\"It's a tremendous lapse of judgment,\" Poe said. \"For the people who lost t=\\nheir life savings and for the participants of the Florida pension fund that=\\n lost $300 million, this seems incredibly insensitive.\"=20\\nIn Connecticut, the Manchester Journal Inquirer reported that Enron spent $=\\n297,150 from 1999 to 2001 for legal and lobbying services. Most of the mone=\\ny went to a firm employing Michael J. Martone, a former top aide to Gov. Jo=\\nhn G. Rowland (R). Martone lobbied the state to fund a fuel-cell project pr=\\noposed by Enron and the Connecticut Resource Recovery Association.=20\\nIn Texas, Enron's collapse has touched scores of politicians. Gov. Rick Per=\\nry (R) has declined to return roughly $200,000 in Enron-related contributio=\\nns. The money includes $25,000 that Lay donated the day after Perry appoint=\\ned Lay's choice, former Enron official Max Yzaguirre, to the Public Utility=\\n Commission.

''Tell =\\nElizabeth Dole we expect the truth,'' the announcer says.=20\\nMary Brown Brewer, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole, called it ''sad that the De=\\nmocrats have already resorted to personal attack ads.'' Ms. Brewer added, '=\\n'It's this kind of bitter partisanship and reckless negativity that voters =\\nare tired of.''=20\\nThe commercial -- unusual at a time when both parties are still holding pri=\\nmary contests in North Carolina -- comes as Democrats have begun trying to =\\nuse the Enron collapse to portray the Bush administration and Congressional=\\n Republicans as tied to wealthy special interests.=20\\nMs. Brewer took issue with the Democrats' advertisement. She said Mrs. Dole=\\n flew to Houston in late September to speak to a Christian women's group, t=\\nhen went to the fund-raiser. She said that it was not secret and that Mrs. =\\nDole would give all contributions from Enron, its executives or its employe=\\nes to a fund for Enron employees. She said that about $5,000 raised at the =\\nHouston event came from Enron.=20\\nUntil now, Democrats had largely used Enron as a metaphor and as a way of r=\\naising doubts about Republican policies.=20\\n''I think we are slowly Enronizing the economy, Enronizing the budget,'' Se=\\nnator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said this month, speaking about the=\\n reappearance of federal deficits.=20\\nIn a Jan. 28 memo to Democrats, three prominent Democratic strategists, Sta=\\nn Greenberg, James Carville and Bob Shrum, said the Enron collapse ''has th=\\ne potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact othe=\\nr issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and the Republica=\\nns.''=20\\nThey wrote that polls showed that the more people heard about the company, =\\n''the more corrosive it becomes.''=20\\n''This is an issue where Democrats ought to talk about right and wrong, gre=\\ned and responsibility,'' they wrote.=20\\nMore than a dozen Congressional investigations into Enron are under way. Bu=\\nt Democrats have been cautious until now about being too overtly political =\\nand have focused on policy. Some party strategists say they do not want to =\\noverplay their hand.=20\\nThis week, after the memo surfaced, Mr. Daschle said, ''The last thing we s=\\nhould do is politicize the scandal.''=20\\nBut the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is closely tied to Mr. Das=\\nchle and is in charge of preserving and increasing the Democrat's fragile m=\\najority.=20\\nJames M. Jordan, the executive director of the Senate Democrat's election c=\\nommittee, argued that the ad ''fundamentally is not about Enron. It's about=\\n her campaign's lack of honesty and about politics as usual.''=20\\nHe said the commercial would run for at least 12 days in major media market=\\ns in North Carolina and on cable television in Washington ''so the Doles ca=\\nn watch the ad in their home at the Watergate.''=20\\nMrs. Dole's primary residence is in Washington along with her husband, Bob.=\\n Democrats have accused her of being a carpetbagger though she grew up in N=\\north Carolina. She recently took title to the North Carolina house where sh=\\ne grew up and her mother still lives.=20\\nThree Democrats are also in a primary battle for Mr. Helms's seat: Erskine =\\nB.

The memo, a copy o=\\nf which Enron gave The Times last spring, called transmission failures a bi=\\ng reason ''the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not=\\n yet reached consumers.''=20\\nThe final energy report reflects some of Enron's positions. The administrat=\\nion said it would urge federal regulators to promote open transmission. It =\\nalso called for a new, self-regulatory body to oversee transmission grids, =\\nas Enron wanted.=20\\nEnron also asked the Bush administration to agree to seize private land for=\\n construction of more transmission towers. The energy plan endorsed that id=\\nea.=20\\nBut the administration declined to pursue the most aggressive of Enron's re=\\ncommendations. Enron wanted the states to lose any jurisdiction over transm=\\nission and proposed to have federal regulators take full control because th=\\ney would presumably break up regional monopolies. But the energy plan endor=\\nsed no such action.=20\\nRepresentative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat whose inquiries pro=\\nmpted the General Accounting Office inquiry last spring, argues that Enron'=\\ns apparent influence was so sweeping that a thorough investigation was need=\\ned into how the administration compiled the energy plan.=20\\nLast month, Mr. Waxman identified 17 items in the report that he said benef=\\nited Enron. He added that ''numerous policies in the White House energy pla=\\nn are virtually identical to the positions Enron advocated.''=20\\nYet some energy experts and lobbyists said that most of the items were not =\\nspecific favors for Enron, but broad policy goals that reflected a consensu=\\ns of many energy companies, including Enron's competitors. When Enron's pol=\\nicy goals did not enjoy broad support, the company often struck out.=20\\nAs a natural gas trader, Enron has long promoted the use of natural gas ove=\\nr coal. It has even advocated that the government cap carbon dioxide emissi=\\nons by power plants as a way of encouraging utilities to switch to cleaner-=\\nburning natural gas. Enron also hoped to profit by trading emission rights.=\\n=20\\nThe administration did not deliver for Enron on these counts.=20\\nOn other issues, Enron's track record was uncertain. During the California =\\nenergy crisis last year, the administration pleased Enron and other energy =\\ntraders by taking a strong stand against caps on electricity prices. The ad=\\nministration also selected two candidates backed by Mr. Lay to serve on the=\\n Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees electricity trading.=\\n=20\\nBut after the two Republican commissioners took office, they quickly adopte=\\nd a plan to impose price controls in California. Some experts argue that th=\\nis step eased price spikes and denied continued high trading profits to Enr=\\non and other companies.=20\\nStill, some critics said that even if the substance of the administration's=\\n energy policies did not always meet Enron's expectations, they often mirro=\\nred longstanding industry goals and neglected the concerns of environmental=\\nists and consumer groups.=20\\n''It was the lips of industry to the ear of God,'' said Mark Cooper of the =\\nConsumer Federation of America.

But shareholder activis=\\nts say weak regulatory requirements, along with a faltering stock market, a=\\nre leading to unchecked growth in executive retirement plans and other bene=\\nfits even as lower-ranking workers face losses and cutbacks in their own pl=\\nans.=20\\n\"The trend has been [for executives] to be greedier and greedier, even thou=\\ngh there's a recession,\" said Cynthia Richson, director of corporate govern=\\nance for the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. \"All this is designed to =\\nkeep executives whole while the rank and file loses ground.\"=20\\nAs many workers' 401(k) retirement plans shrink, executives at some compani=\\nes get guaranteed returns on their investments. Other companies pour hundre=\\nds of millions into special executive-only retirement accounts. Firms also =\\npay for big insurance policies and offer executives multimillion-dollar loa=\\nns, complete with below-market interest rates and a company promise to forg=\\nive some of the payments.=20\\nUnlike salaries, bonuses and stock options--which must be laid out in gover=\\nnment filings--the true cost of these benefits is often difficult, if not i=\\nmpossible, for outsiders to determine, said Ken Bertsch, director of corpor=\\nate governance for TIAA-CREF, the world's largest pension fund manager.=20\\nFor a variety of accounting and regulatory reasons, companies often are not=\\n required to report the price tag for many of their executive benefits to t=\\nhe Securities and Exchange Commission. When benefits are disclosed, their c=\\nosts can be tucked into footnotes or lumped into a catchall category of \"ot=\\nher compensation,\" said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, which =\\ntracks compensation trends.=20\\nThe costs of many executive retirement plans are particularly easy to hide,=\\n since companies have to reveal few details, compensation experts said.=20\\n\"The regulatory disclosure rules are so weak, [companies] can get away with=\\n one or two ambiguously worded sentences in the middle of a paragraph about=\\n the rank-and-file [retirement] plan,\" Richson said.=20\\nThese feeble disclosure requirements, combined with poor stock market perfo=\\nrmance, have spawned a cottage industry in the last year of compensation co=\\nnsultants who are promoting supplemental executive retirement arrangements,=\\n benefits experts said. These plans are designed and promoted specifically =\\nas a way to enhance compensation that's \"off the radar screen of shareholde=\\nrs,\" Richson and other compensation experts said.=20\\nUnlike stock options or bonuses, which are tied to the company's performanc=\\ne, executives benefit from these supplemental retirement plans whether or n=\\not the company does well.=20\\nExecutives can lose these retirement benefits if the company declares bankr=\\nuptcy, since the plans are not protected by the government-run Pension Bene=\\nfit Guaranty Corp. But shareholder activists say most executives are at lit=\\ntle risk because relatively few companies actually go broke.=20\\nCompanies say they need to offer ample benefits to attract and retain top-f=\\nlight managers. In addition, many of the plans designed for rank-and-file w=\\norkers don't provide enough retirement pay for executives used to living on=\\n much higher salaries, compensation consultants said.=20\\nTraditional pension plans limit benefits to highly paid executives because =\\nthe plans can take into account no more than $200,000 of salary when determ=\\nining benefits. The IRS also requires companies to cap the 401(k) contribut=\\nions of their highest-paid workers, so many executives are prevented from m=\\naking the full $11,000 annual contributions the law otherwise allows.=20\\nAbout 60% of the executive retirement plans Mercer surveyed in 1998 made up=\\n for the benefits that otherwise would have been lost to IRS rules, said Ja=\\nnet M. Den Uyl, head of executive benefits and compensation for William M. =\\nMercer Inc., a compensation consultant.=20\\nThe 40% of companies that offer richer plans--either to all their executive=\\ns or to their top one or two leaders--often are trying to lure talent from =\\nother firms or prevent defections, Den Uyl said.=20\\nThe richest arrangements of all, not surprisingly, are aimed at the compani=\\nes' top leaders.=20\\n\"There's more license at the CEO level,\" Den Uyl said. Most CEOs already ha=\\nve rich compensation packages, \"and they're not ready to throw those away\" =\\nwhen hired by a new company.=20\\nHere are some of the non-salary perks companies have made available to top =\\nmanagers:=20\\n* Guaranteed returns on investment. Top executives at Enron could contribut=\\ne salary and bonuses to so-called deferred compensation accounts with guara=\\nnteed minimum annual returns of 12%. Struggling telecom-equipment giant Luc=\\nent Technologies Inc. has a similar plan that promises to pay five percenta=\\nge points more than the 10-year Treasury rate. Currently, that Treasury rat=\\ne is about 5%, which means Lucent executives in the plan get a 10% return o=\\nn their investments.=20\\nEnron and Lucent are far from alone. About half the companies that offer de=\\nferred compensation plans provide a guaranteed minimum return, according to=\\n a Mercer study.=20\\n* Bigger company matches. The typical company match for a 401(k) defined co=\\nntribution plan is 50 cents for every dollar the employee contributes, up t=\\no 6% of the worker's salary. For a worker who takes full advantage of the c=\\nompany match, the employer's contribution represents 3% of his or her pay, =\\nor $1,500 a year for a worker making $50,000.=20\\nThe company contribution for an executive version of a 401(k) is typically =\\n60% higher. The average company contributes 5%, and nearly half of the comp=\\nanies surveyed contribute even more, the Mercer study found.=20\\nThe dollar amounts contributed can be substantial. Intel Corp. contributed =\\n$1.3 million to the defined contribution accounts of its top five executive=\\ns in 2000, including nearly $400,000 to the account of Chief Executive Crai=\\ng R. Barrett, whose salary and bonuses that year totaled $3.4 million. But =\\nunlike many other firms, Intel makes such contributions for all of the abou=\\nt 10,000 employees whose ability to contribute to the regular 401(k) is res=\\ntricted, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said.=20\\n* Huge low-cost loans. SEC filings show telecom company Global Crossing Ltd=\\n., which filed for bankruptcy protection this week, made an $8-million loan=\\n to then-Chief Executive Thomas J. Casey in November 2000 and a $1.8-millio=\\nn loan to President David Walsh in March 2001. Both loans were secured by t=\\nhe executives' homes, but the interest rates they paid--6.01% for Casey, 4.=\\n75% for Walsh--were three to four percentage points below prevailing rates =\\non standard home equity loans at the time.=20\\nEnron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, frequently tapped a $7.5-mi=\\nllion line of credit he could repay with company stock that Enron had given=\\n him or that he had purchased with low-cost company-provided options. His p=\\nredecessor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, was given a $2-million loan. Enron had off=\\nered to forgive the payments if Skilling stayed with the company until Dec.=\\n 31, 2001, but he resigned Aug. 14.=20\\n* Lavish life insurance. Many workers get some life insurance through their=\\n employers--typically $50,000 or one year's pay.=20\\nExecutives can get much more. About one-quarter of companies in the Mercer =\\nstudy have special executive life insurance programs that typically pay for=\\n coverage equal to three to four times the executives' annual pay.=20\\nSometimes the benefit is much higher. In 2000, Cendant Corp., a travel and =\\nreal estate company, paid $3.7 million in premiums on a $100-million life i=\\nnsurance policy for its chief executive, Henry R. Silverman, 60. Under the =\\narrangement, known as a split-dollar policy, Cendant will recoup its premiu=\\nms from the life insurance proceeds when Silverman dies, with Silverman's h=\\neirs receiving the rest of the money, according to Cendant's latest SEC fil=\\ning.=20\\n* Company-paid taxes. Companies pay a variety of tax bills for certain exec=\\nutives. When benefits are so great that they incur a tax bill from the IRS-=\\n-as they often do--some executives are given money to pay the tax. Because =\\nthat cash payment also incurs income tax, companies often add an additional=\\n sum to cover the extra tax--a process known as \"grossing up.\"=20\\nLucent Chairman Henry B. Schacht was given $57,325 to pay tax on \"certain f=\\nringe benefits\" in 2000, according to the company's SEC filings. Ray R. Iri=\\ntani, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, was reimbursed $486,918 for =\\ntaxes in 1999--and $95,000 for tax preparation services, SEC filings show.=\\n=20\\n* Fringe benefits. Other perks, such as the personal use of corporate jets,=\\n company-provided chauffeurs and company-paid financial planning, can add t=\\nens of thousands of dollars to an executive's total compensation.=20\\nThe footnotes of Lucent's SEC filings show the company paid $26,351 for per=\\nsonal financial planning advice for Schacht in a year in which he received =\\na $1.1-million paycheck. At Enron, Lay's personal use of a corporate jet in=\\n 2000 was worth $334,179.=20\\nShareholder activists note that many of the most lavish arrangements have b=\\neen uncovered at companies that have since hit hard times--among them Enron=\\n, whose compensation philosophy, according to SEC filings, was \"to reward e=\\nxecutive performance that creates long-term shareholder value.\"=20\\n\"At a minimum, it's inconsistent for companies and executives to just keep =\\nfeasting\" when financial performance falters, stock prices drop and other e=\\nmployees face cutbacks, Richson, of the Wisconsin Investment Board, said. \"=\\nIt's bordering on unethical.\"\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

So maybe it's a=\\n good time to rescue ethical behavior from the professional ethicists.=20\\nWe've come in for criticism lately because one of our contributors, the Bri=\\ntish conservative writer Roger Scruton, wrote an essay for our European edi=\\ntion while being paid by a Japanese tobacco company. The British Guardian t=\\nurned up an e-mail in the name of his wife and business partner Sophie to J=\\napan Tobacco proposing an increase in their retainer, in return for placing=\\n articles in the \"WSJ, the Times, the Telegraph, the Spectator, the Financi=\\nal Times, the Economist\" and so on.\\nNow, Professor Scruton -- a free-marketeer with well-known views -- was a c=\\nontributor for us long before he took a dime from Big Tobacco. His point of=\\n view is of course precisely why the left-wing Guardian wants to portray hi=\\nm as tainted by filthy lucre. These are the same ethicists who lack the sam=\\ne passion for disclosure when it comes to finding out, for example, whether=\\n Ralph Nader is financed by trial lawyers.=20\\nOur own view is that the financing of the advocate matters far less than th=\\ne quality of the advocacy. But our long-time standard is also that such fin=\\nancial ties should be disclosed, so readers can make up their own minds. Mr=\\n. Scruton had an obligation to tell us and his readers about his tobacco fi=\\nnancing when he was writing about tobacco issues; he didn't, and so he will=\\n be taking a holiday from our pages.=20\\nMeanwhile, the Internet ethicist, Andrew Sullivan, has been denouncing any =\\njournalist who's ever taken a dollar from Enron. This includes our contribu=\\ntor Peggy Noonan, who disclosed last week in her OpinionJournal.com column =\\nthat she billed Enron $250 an hour for 100 to 200 hours of speech-writing w=\\nork. In other words, she got paid like any other contract employee, which i=\\ns called business between consenting adults. The first time she wrote about=\\n Enron for us was also when she disclosed her Enron fees, so she has nothin=\\ng to apologize for.=20\\nCertainly not to Mr. Sullivan, who recently wrote a fine piece for this pag=\\ne on the failure of Talk magazine but then without asking re-sold the artic=\\nle to the Times of London, which didn't bother to give us credit. Mr. Sulli=\\nvan's explanation is that he didn't think we had international publication =\\nrights, although The Wall Street Journal Europe is distributed in London. L=\\neaving aside the fine points of copyright law, Mr. Sullivan's behavior may =\\nnot have been \"unethical\" but it wasn't very nice.=20\\nWhich brings us to a larger point this page has often made about conflicts =\\nof interest and honesty. Avoiding the first is not the same as the latter; =\\nsometimes persnickety rules can become a license for larger dishonesty. So,=\\n for example, the U.S. Senate poses as a more honest place because it passe=\\ns a ban on accepting gifts. But then New Jersey Senator Bob Torricelli is a=\\nble to evade the ban by claiming that the Italian suits he received from a =\\ncampaign contributor were from a \"friend,\" a legal loophole.=20\\nThe same applies to intellectual honesty in journalism. At least Mr. Scruto=\\nn, whatever his disclosure oversight, took money from people he agrees with=\\n. But New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has recently given himself a fr=\\nee ethical pass because he says he disclosed his former Enron ties once he =\\nbecame a columnist.=20\\nMr. Krugman wrote a puff piece on the company for Fortune magazine while he=\\n was getting $50,000 as an Enron adviser, but he now denounces politicians =\\nand anyone else close to Enron for \"crony capitalism.\" We'll let our reader=\\ns judge the ethics of that.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Mr. Taylor, a 24-year-old computer program=\\nmer from Oakland, Calif., put down the puppet he was wrestling and tried to=\\n stifle his indignation.=20\\n''If you want to know what those young crazy radical activists are up to, y=\\nou've come to the right place,'' he said, glancing around a vast industrial=\\n space buzzing with politically minded artisans and packed with their handi=\\nwork. ''I'm really getting sick of that question.''\\nWhile the police on the streets seemed to be steeling themselves for civic =\\nunrest, the atmosphere yesterday morning inside the garage, along the West =\\nSide Highway at 57th Street, was anything but martial. The message from Mr.=\\n Taylor and two dozen other volunteers was clear: make art, not war.=20\\nThere was, however, a looming sense of panic as the hours passed and the af=\\nternoon debut of this cardboard pageantry neared. There were robber-baron s=\\ntyle top hats bearing the words ''WEF: We Are All En-Wrong'' and beachball-=\\nsized wine goblets painted like globes that read ''Earth For Sale.'' A blow=\\nn-up photograph of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive =\\nof Enron, leaned against a pillar, not far from a row of huge pretzels, an =\\napparent reference to the snack food that recently felled President Bush as=\\n he watched a football game.=20\\nOver the past week, scores of volunteers from across the country have been =\\nflocking to the space to glue, paint and stitch together props that will an=\\nimate the street protests accompanying the World Economic Forum. Two New Yo=\\nrk organizations, Arts in Action and Time's Up, helped put together the mak=\\neshift workshop.=20\\nBut alongside the levity yesterday afternoon there was an undercurrent of f=\\near. Many of those planning to join the protests said they were worried abo=\\nut the potential for violence at the hands of the police. Others said they =\\nwere frustrated by journalists' single-minded focus on the potential for Se=\\nattle-style disturbances. ''We're not out there to fight with the police,''=\\n said Payal Parekh, 28, an oceanography graduate student from Boston who wa=\\ns helping to organize the puppet making. ''We're trying to get our voices h=\\neard but the media is obsessed with security issues.''=20\\nWhether or not their fears are real, even those organizing the puppet works=\\nhop were not taking any chances. Bill DiPaola of Time's Up tried to find a =\\nbackup location, just in case something were to go awry. ''You can't be too=\\n careful about these things,'' he said.=20\\nStill, with the demonstration at the Gap at 54th Street near Fifth Avenue a=\\nlready under way, there were more pressing concerns. Clapping to get the ro=\\nom's attention, someone urged the crowd at the garage to head east and ''he=\\nlp animate the images we created.'' A pickup truck was loaded with props; e=\\nveryone else took the crosstown bus. Ten minutes later, the truck pulled up=\\n to the curb at 54th Street and into the arms of the police. ''I promise th=\\nere are no rocks or bottles,'' one woman joked to an officer who was visibl=\\ny suspicious. ''It's just a bunch of goofy puppets.'' After a brief verbal =\\ntussle and a few tense moments, the police relented, gave the group five mi=\\nnutes to unload and everyone, it seemed, was happy.\\n\\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
